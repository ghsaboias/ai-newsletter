# Welcome to December 21, 2025

The black box has installed a mirror. Anthropic has successfully trained [“Activation Oracles,” LLMs that accept neural activations as input](https://alignment.anthropic.com/2025/activation-oracles/) to interrogate their own internal states, uncovering secret knowledge and misalignment that fine-tuning tried to hide, meaning the machine is now capable of psychoanalyzing its own weights. This recursive introspection is matched by observational osmosis. Nvidia introduced [NitroGen, a vision-action foundation model](https://nitrogen.minedojo.org/) trained on 40,000 hours of Twitch and YouTube gameplay, achieving a 52% performance jump by learning to hallucinate the optimal path through 1,000 different gaming environments. Even the training loop is collapsing, as a [new NanoGPT speedrun record of 127.7 seconds](https://x.com/classiclarryd/status/2002482925741486381) proves that basic competence is collapsing into a computational rounding error.

Physics is being reduced to a solvable heuristic. Former DeepMind director David Budden has [wagered $10,000 that he will solve the Navier-Stokes existence and smoothness problem](https://x.com/davidmbudden/status/2002628914301317334) by the end of the year, betting that chaos is just a lack of compute. We are already digitizing the ontogeny of life. MIT researchers trained a [generative model that predicts fruit fly embryo development](https://news.mit.edu/2025/deep-learning-model-predicts-how-fruit-flies-form-1215) with 90% accuracy, predicting cellular folding minute-by-minute and effectively turning developmental biology into a predictive video stream. In the macro world, Tsinghua researchers unlocked a [catalytic process converting polystyrene waste to toluene](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41565-025-02069-x), cutting carbon emissions by 53% and turning pollution back into feedstock.

The substrate is learning to heal itself. A [neutral atom quantum computer can now repair itself in real time](https://journals.aps.org/prx/abstract/10.1103/v7ny-fg31) by detecting lost qubits and physically dragging new atoms into place to replace them, decoupling calculation from the survival of the hardware. Traditional silicon is accelerating to match, as TSMC is [pulling forward 3-nm production in its second Arizona fab to 2027](https://asia.nikkei.com/business/tech/semiconductors/tsmc-to-install-cutting-edge-3-nm-chip-tools-in-arizona-next-summer) and slashing quarters off the roadmap. In orbit, the propulsion systems are scaling up. L3Harris and NASA delivered the [most powerful electric thrusters ever built for the Lunar Gateway](https://www.l3harris.com/newsroom/press-release/2025/12/l3harris-delivers-most-powerful-thrusters-nasas-lunar-gateway), preparing to shove stations into deep space.

Automation is conquering the last mile of dexterity and navigation. Kyber Labs demonstrated [robot hands capable of fine mechanical assembly](https://x.com/kyberlabsrobots/status/2002150288799772855), solving the hardware friction that software agents previously couldn’t touch. On the roads, [Tesla FSD now hunts for free parking spots and parks autonomously](https://x.com/Tesla/status/2002238787447849149), removing the human driver from the final logistical link. Digital agents are evolving just as quickly. [Google’s Antigravity system has been upgraded with Gemini 3 Flash](https://x.com/_mohansolo/status/2002123628553584707) to handle long-horizon browser tasks, while Suno’s [Voice Personas now allow consistent vocal identity](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09pG2UFHra4) across entire generative music albums.

The evolutionary premium on specialization is collapsing. Research suggests that human training should look more like AI generalist training, as [late-blooming multidisciplinary adults eventually overtake early-specialist prodigies](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adt7790). Meanwhile, we are recognizing the minds of others. [Medical experiments on dogs are phasing out](https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2025-12-20/experimenting-on-dogs-is-getting-harder-to-defend) due to new cell culture tech and proof of rich non-human animal cognition, while [Italian bears are evolving to be smaller and less aggressive](https://academic.oup.com/mbe/article/42/12/msaf292/8355027) to survive near human villages, marking a rapid and unspoken uplift.

White-collar prestige is revealing itself to be a relic of scarcity. A senior English barrister watched [Grok Heavy write a complex civil appeal in 30 seconds](https://spectator.com/article/ai-will-kill-all-the-lawyers/) that beat his own day-and-a-half effort, and lamented that “AI is coming for us all.” The smart money is already automated, with [independent quants reportedly earning $2 million a year](https://x.com/argona0x/status/2002391129870803306) arbitraging inefficiencies in prediction markets like Polymarket. As usual, Tyler Cowen is ahead of the curve, [writing specifically to be read by AI](https://x.com/emollick/status/2002546946721112173) as Claude 4.5 Opus traces reveal it reads his blog solely to confirm pre-trained priors. Governance is attempting to buffer the shock, as New York defied the White House to sign the [RAISE Act](https://www.wsj.com/articles/new-york-signs-ai-safety-bill-into-law-ignoring-trump-executive-order-f1ece21d). Starting January 1, 2027, the law requires companies with over $500 million in revenue to publish protocols for preventing critical harm and report any serious breaches or face fines, effectively regulating large AI systems locally.

Identity is now verified by the physics of the network. A North Korean imposter at Amazon was [unmasked not by credentials but by a 110-millisecond keystroke lag](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-12-17/amazon-caught-north-korean-it-worker-by-tracing-keystroke-data), the unavoidable signature of remotely controlling a machine from across the Pacific.

We have optimized away the pause between thought and reality.
