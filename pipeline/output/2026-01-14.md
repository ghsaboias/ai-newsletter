# Welcome to January 14, 2026

The Singularity is now proving theorems that humans cannot. Ravi Vakil, president of the American Mathematical Society, has used Gemini Deep Think to [prove a new result in Algebraic Geometry](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07222). He admits the AI produced insights he is [“unsure he could have reached alone,”](https://x.com/a_g_i_joe/status/2011213878395617571) propelling the project forward intellectually. More broadly, mathematics is finally succumbing to automation. Harmonic, flush with $295 million, has [announced plans to solve the Riemann Hypothesis, Hodge Conjecture, and Millennium Prize problems](https://x.com/mollysoshea/status/2010872103118258226).

The workforce is scaling horizontally into the synthetic realm. A startup called Atoms has launched an [autonomous AI team that builds, launches, and scales real businesses](https://atoms.dev/). Salesforce released Slackbot as an [“out-of-the-box employee agent,”](https://investor.salesforce.com/news/news-details/2026/Salesforce-Announces-the-General-Availability-of-Slackbot--Your-Personal-Agent-for-Work/default.aspx) treating humans and agents as fungible assets. Privacy remains a premium in this new stack. Signal creator Moxie Marlinspike has launched Confer, an open-source AI assistant that is [cryptographically verifiable to be unreadable](https://arstechnica.com/security/2026/01/signal-creator-moxie-marlinspike-wants-to-do-for-ai-what-he-did-for-messaging/) by anyone but the user. Meanwhile, the scale of creation is going vertical. Google announced that Nano Banana Pro has been used to [generate 1 billion images in its first 53 days](https://x.com/joshwoodward/status/2010806443314987295). The company also [upgraded Veo 3.1 to allow identity consistency](https://blog.google/innovation-and-ai/technology/ai/veo-3-1-ingredients-to-video/) across video generation. To consume this flood of reality, Meta and EssilorLuxottica are [doubling smart glass production to 20 million units](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-01-13/meta-said-to-discuss-doubling-ray-ban-glasses-output-after-surge-in-demand) a year.

The energy grid is expanding into the vacuum. Overview Energy has emerged from stealth after successfully [beaming power from an aircraft to a ground receiver via near-infrared laser](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/overview-energy-exits-stealth-with-worlds-first-airborne-power-beaming-demonstration-for-space-solar-energy-302637459.html). They plan orbital power transmission by 2028. NASA and the DOE are partnering to [deploy a lunar surface fission reactor by 2030](https://www.nasa.gov/news-release/nasa-department-of-energy-to-develop-lunar-surface-reactor-by-2030/). On Earth, Microsoft has [hired 570 energy specialists](https://www.cnbc.com/2026/01/14/big-tech-google-microsoft-energy-hiring-ai.html) since 2022 and pledged to [“pay our way,”](https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2026/01/13/community-first-ai-infrastructure/) asking utilities to set rates high enough to cover data center costs without hiking consumer bills. The market is rewarding the picks and shovels. Caterpillar, better known for its tractors, has crossed a [$300 billion valuation](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-01-13/caterpillar-crosses-300-billion-in-market-value-on-ai-rally) as a secondary AI play for backup power generation.

Silicon sovereignty is becoming the primary directive. The US will now [allow Nvidia to sell H200 chips to China](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-01-13/us-clears-path-for-nvidia-to-sell-h200s-to-china-via-new-rule), but China is simultaneously [restricting domestic purchases](https://www.theinformation.com/articles/china-restricts-nvidia-chip-purchases-special-circumstances) to force reliance on local silicon. This constraint appears to be breeding resilience. Zhipu released GLM-Image, reportedly the first multimodal foundation model [fully trained on Huawei chips](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-01-14/china-s-zhipu-unveils-new-ai-model-trained-on-huawei-s-chips). Meanwhile, specialty silicon is booming. Etched has now [raised $500 million](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-01-13/ai-chip-startup-etched-raises-500-million-to-take-on-nvidia) to compete with Nvidia. Cerebras is eyeing a [$22 billion valuation](https://www.theinformation.com/articles/chipmaker-cerebras-talks-raise-1-billion-22-billion-valuation) ahead of its IPO, aiming to break the GPU monopoly with wafer-scale compute.

Kinetic intelligence is becoming a metered utility. Tesla will [stop selling Full Self-Driving for a one-time fee](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-01-14/tesla-driver-assist-system-fsd-will-switch-to-subscription-only-musk-says) next month, transitioning entirely to a monthly rental model. In logistics, German startup Filics is replacing forklifts with [autonomous mobile robots that swarm omnidirectionally](https://x.com/tansuyegen/status/2010954624782716981) under pallets.

Medicine is being refactored into an API. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services is reportedly hoping to [FDA-approve autonomous prescribing agents](https://x.com/sebastiancaliri/status/2011257127361548790) within two years. To support this, Google released [MedGemma 1.5, an open-weight model](https://research.google/blog/next-generation-medical-image-interpretation-with-medgemma-15-and-medical-speech-to-text-with-medasr/) for medical imaging and report understanding. Meanwhile, the FDA itself is modernizing. It announced a [transition to Bayesian statistics](https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/fda-issues-guidance-modernizing-statistical-methods-clinical-trials) for clinical trials to leverage existing information for accelerated drug approvals.

The economy is aggressively reallocating human capital to feed the intelligence explosion. RationalFX calculates that [244,851 tech jobs were cut globally in 2025](https://www.rationalfx.com/forex-brokers/global-tech-sector-layoffs/) as firms restructured operations to focus on AI-driven productivity. Europe is attempting to catch up to this new reality. The European Frontier AI Initiative has reportedly [attracted its first 30 researchers](https://www.mlex.com/mlex/amp/articles/2429406) to host a sovereign frontier lab.

Imagination is one of the last remaining bottlenecks, and we’re scaling that too.
