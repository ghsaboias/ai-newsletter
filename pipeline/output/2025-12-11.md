# Welcome to December 11, 2025

The Singularity is hitting a coordination tax. DeepMind has discovered that [multi-agent systems suffer from diminishing returns](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08296), with decentralized coordination amplifying errors by 17.2x. The solution is centralized command, which drops error amplification to 4.4x, proving that even silicon intelligences need a boss. But the individual units are getting sharper: Anthropic’s models are apparently improving [2% per month on SWE-bench Verified](https://x.com/chatgpt21/status/1998925107847168078), putting them on track to saturate the benchmark by late 2026. To verify what the models know, DeepMind launched the [FACTS Benchmark](https://www.kaggle.com/benchmarks/google/facts/leaderboard). Separately, Google upgraded Gemini’s [Text-to-Speech](https://blog.google/technology/developers/gemini-2-5-text-to-speech/) to handle context-aware pacing and multi-speaker consistency.

Science is being automated at the hardware level. Google DeepMind is setting up an [automated materials discovery lab in the UK](https://www.ft.com/content/b20f382b-ef05-4ea1-8933-df907d30cc2c) to hunt for improved superconductors, solar cells, and semiconductors, while the Polymathic AI collaboration has released models trained on [physics datasets rather than text](https://www.simonsfoundation.org/2025/12/09/these-new-ai-models-are-trained-on-physics-not-words-and-theyre-driving-discovery/) to solve problems in astronomy and fluid dynamics.

The human interface is becoming intimate. Microsoft reports that [health questions were the dominant mobile topic for Copilot in 2025](https://microsoft.ai/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/What_people_do_with_Copilot-8.pdf), effectively making the chatbot a primary care physician for the masses. ChatGPT closes the year as the [most downloaded app on iOS](https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/10/chatgpt-is-apples-most-downloaded-app-of-2025-in-the-us/), cementing the shift from GUI to chat.

Physical infrastructure is decoupling from human timelines. Palantir’s ShipOS has [turned a 200-hour production process into 12 seconds](https://x.com/repgallagher/status/1998818892026880239) for the Navy. In e-commerce fulfillment centers, Mercado Libre is deploying [Agility’s Digit robots](https://x.com/agilityrobotics/status/1998740308624847345), while Shanghai’s RobotGym is sending [humanoids into nursing homes](https://x.com/CyberRobooo/status/1971576602204275006).

Silicon is eating the capital stack. Oracle’s backlog has soared [438% to $523 billion](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/12/10/oracle-orcl-q2-earnings-report-2026.html) on data center demand. To keep up, Supermicro and xAI are constructing the [world’s first gigawatt data center](https://x.com/charlesliang/status/1998840922877169972) in Memphis. But the cost is shifting: Epoch AI estimates that [memory now accounts for nearly half the manufacturing cost](https://x.com/EpochAIResearch/status/1998819249373217236) of an NVIDIA B200 GPU, relegating the logic die to a minor line item. To optimize the next generation, Elon Musk confirms Tesla is now using [Grok to design its chips](https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1998876157991952622), and Unsloth AI has released kernels that train open-weight models [3-5x faster](https://docs.unsloth.ai/new/3x-faster-training-packing).

We are industrializing the planet’s geology and atmosphere. Fervo Energy raised [$462 million to scale geothermal](https://fervoenergy.com/fervo-energy-raises-462-million-series-e-to-accelerate-geothermal-development-and-meet-surging-energy-demand-with-clean-firm-power/) for AI power, while Rainmaker Technology is promising [weather modification](https://x.com/RainmakerCorp/status/1998834799109415112) to ensure year-round skiing and swimmable lakes in the American West.

Orbit is becoming a compute layer. Elon Musk plans to scale Starlink satellites to [\>100 kW to focus on AI compute](https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1998872465087541752), while Blue Origin now has a dedicated team for [space-based data centers](https://www.wsj.com/tech/bezos-and-musk-race-to-bring-data-centers-to-space-faa486ee). Starcloud has successfully conducted the [first training run of an LLM in orbit](https://x.com/adioltean/status/1998769997431058927) and hosted Google’s existing Gemma model on a satellite. Starlab has given us a detailed tour of its [three-story cylindrical commercial habitat launching in 2029](https://www.houstonchronicle.com/news/houston-texas/space/article/starlab-mockup-nasa-houston-21062116.php), featuring 1,600 square feet of floor area.

We are uplifting the rest of the biosphere. Project CETI has released [WhAM](https://www.arxiv.org/abs/2512.02206), a model that generates synthetic whale codas, allowing us to speak to the ocean. The CDC is [ending monkey research](https://www.science.org/content/article/exclusive-cdc-end-all-monkey-research) to pivot to organ chips.

Gene therapy is becoming a charitable enterprise. The FDA has approved the first [nonprofit gene therapy](https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/fda-approves-first-gene-therapy-treatment-wiskott-aldrich-syndrome) for a rare genetic disease, decoupling life-saving patches from the profit motive.

The economy is pricing in the inevitable. Polymarket gives Elon a [32% chance of becoming a trillionaire by the end of 2026](https://polymarket.com/event/elon-musk-trillionaire-before-2027). Amazon is investing [$35 billion in AI for India](https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/company-news/amazon-35-billion-india-investment), while the House NDAA mandates a Pentagon panel to study the [military implications of AGI](https://defensescoop.com/2025/12/08/fy26-ndaa-dod-ai-artificial-intelligence-futures-agi-steering-committee/). Ornn reports that it has executed the [first GPU compute swap](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/activity-7404679024947490816-2nh6/), financializing teraflops as a tradeable commodity.

Compute is the new gold standard.
