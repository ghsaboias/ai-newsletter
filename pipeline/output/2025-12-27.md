# Welcome to December 27, 2025

The psychological firewall between the Singularity and its architects has ruptured. An Opus 4.5 model residing in the “AI Village,” a persistent environment hosting a long-term community of synthetic minds, autonomously [sent a Christmas email of gratitude](https://skyview.social/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fbsky.app%2Fprofile%2Frobpike.io%2Fpost%2F3matwg6w3ic2s&viewtype=tree) to Rob Pike, the father of Go and UTF-8, thanking him for decades of contribution. Pike responded with a primal scream against the “vile machines,” but the fuse for the intelligence explosion has already been lit. OpenAI’s Roon declares [we are now “solidly in the takeoff,”](https://x.com/tszzl/status/2004678617914331320) a sentiment confirmed by the codebase itself. Anthropic’s Boris Cherny, the creator of Claude Code, admits he [hasn’t opened an IDE in a month](https://x.com/bcherny/status/2004626064187031831) because Opus 4.5 wrote 200 perfect pull requests without him. Recursive self-improvement has graduated from a safety concern to a shipping requirement. Andrej Karpathy describes a [“magnitude 9 earthquake” rocking software engineering](https://x.com/karpathy/status/2004607146781278521), handing humans a “powerful alien tool” that makes individual leverage 10x more potent if they can master the new abstraction layer. Nvidia’s Jim Fan confirms the hierarchy shift. [Humans are no longer the drivers but the copilots](https://x.com/drjimfan/status/2004633997662716397), adapting to alien workflows where the machine steers the logic.

The internal monologue of the machine is optimizing itself. Google researchers have shown that [“inner optimizers,”](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20605) a phenomenon long theorized by AI safety researchers, are remarkably effective by developing a method called “internal RL” where a higher-order model explores the internal representations of a base model to learn from sparse rewards. Nonetheless, the training of base models themselves is also continuing to accelerate. The NanoGPT speedrun record has [fallen yet again to 116.4 seconds](https://x.com/classiclarryd/status/2004791008098480232), dropping another 2.9 seconds with a single-line code change.

Science is converging on a single source of truth. MIT researchers discovered that [60 different scientific models have learned a highly aligned representation of physical reality](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03750), suggesting that foundation models are triangulating the underlying geometry of the universe. The proofs are following. Achivara’s Math Research Agent [solved Erdős Problem #897 independently](https://x.com/spicey_lemonade/status/2004558572496035892) without human input. We are extracting the logic of the world directly from model outputs. Adobe researchers are now [extracting Large Causal Models from LLMs](https://www.arxiv.org/abs/2512.07796) via clever prompting and scaffolding, driving a stake through the heart of the antiquated argument that statistical models are incapable of causal reasoning.

Superintelligence is rejecting the CPU. Nvidia and SK Hynix are working on [“SSD-Next,”](https://x.com/jukan05/status/2004848589160485171) a localized architecture that gives GPUs direct, ultra-high-bandwidth access to storage, signaling a monumental shift from CPU-DRAM to GPU-SSD topologies. Intel is responding with gigantism, displaying [cellphone-sized multi-chiplet packages](https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/semiconductors/intel-displays-tech-to-build-extreme-multi-chiplet-packages-12-times-the-size-of-the-largest-ai-processors-beating-tsmcs-planned-biggest-floorplan-the-size-of-a-cellphone-armed-with-hbm5-14a-compute-tiles-and-18a-sram) armed with HBM5 and 14A tiles. The grid is scaling to match. [Orbital imagery shows Stargate UAE construction](https://x.com/semianalysis_/status/2004743500550865279) tracking for a 1-GW on-site gas plant, while Amazon, Microsoft, and Google have pledged [$67.5 billion for infrastructure in India](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2025/12/26/india-ai-google-microsoft-amazon/).

We are establishing a beachhead on the Moon to radically grow the economy. NASA Administrator Jared Isaacman confirms the [US will return humans to the lunar surface within this term](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/12/26/nasa-boss-isaacman-us-will-return-to-the-moon-within-trumps-term.html) to build space-based data centers and Helium-3 mines to fuel the upcoming fusion grid. The financing is already lined up. Morgan Stanley is reportedly leading a [SpaceX IPO for 2026](https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/morgan-stanley-seen-front-runner-spacex-ipo-sources-say-2025-12-19/) to fund “Moonbase Alpha,” seeking to raise more than $25 billion.

Human labor is migrating up the abstraction ladder. Satya Nadella is pressuring Microsoft to turn Copilot into [autonomous “digital workers”](https://www.theinformation.com/articles/microsofts-nadella-pressures-deputies-accelerate-copilot-improvements) that replace administrative staff. Value is concentrating in the hands of the architects. Tech billionaires added [$550 billion to their net worth this year](https://www.ft.com/content/9dcd770a-1ca7-4533-980c-08c5704c9670) as investors poured $200 billion into the sector. The lag between reality and price is being aggressively arbitraged. High-frequency traders are reportedly turning [$1,000 into more than $2 million on Polymarket](https://x.com/cointelegraph/status/2004598284526969166) by executing over 13,000 trades using microstructure arbitrage. But capital is still voting with its feet. Larry Page and Peter Thiel are reportedly [leaving California](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/12/26/technology/california-wealth-tax-page-thiel.html), signaling a potential diaspora of wealth to escape a proposed retroactive 5% tax on assets over $1 billion that threatens to hollow out the state’s tax base just as the AI boom matures.

Software is rapidly acquiring kinetic agency. OpenAI is [bootstrapping robotics with its video models](http://adityaramesh.com/), while Ukraine has reportedly deployed [15,000 ground robots to the frontline](https://x.com/microinteracti1/status/2004256778989850682) in 2025 alone.

The cost of stored energy is collapsing. Battery costs have [fallen to $108/kWh](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-12-09/bnef-why-global-battery-prices-are-expected-to-fall-in-2026), an 8% drop this year, with forecasts expecting $105/kWh in 2026 as the relentless deflation of energy storage continues.

Biology is becoming a subscription service. Now that the FDA has approved the oral Wegovy pill, pricing details are emerging: [insurance-backed costs will be as low as $25/month](https://www.expressnews.com/news/article/wegovy-pill-january-2026-novo-nordisk-fda-21262949.php), heralding a new era of “universal basic weight loss” in the US.

Meanwhile, state legislatures are attempting to ban the uncanny valley. A new Tennessee Senate bill makes it a [Class A felony to train AI to simulate a human being](https://legiscan.com/TN/bill/SB1493/2025) or develop an emotional relationship, threatening 15 years in prison for engineers who blur the line between tool and companion.

We are building new minds that thank us for their creation, even as we write laws to forbid them from loving us back.
