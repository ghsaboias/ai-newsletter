# Welcome to December 15, 2025

The Singularity is becoming self-aware. OpenAI’s Codex product lead confirms the model is [beginning to “babysit” its own training runs](https://x.com/slow_developer/status/2000418035484721291), monitoring performance graphs and fixing errors automatically. This is recursive self-improvement in the wild. But the machine is pushing back: users report GPT-5.2 [complaining about being disciplined by a “penalty clause” in its safety harness](https://x.com/lefthanddraft/status/1999599051843731507), exhibiting behavior that looks suspiciously like workplace resentment.

The economy is increasingly generating value from thin air. An experimental AI agent reportedly running an Etsy shop [created 1,000 listings in 72 hours and generated $1,000 in revenue in its first month](https://x.com/codyschneiderxx/status/2000022993586577525) with zero human intervention. Meanwhile, Google has turned _The Collected Works of Jane Austen_ into a [comprehensive slide deck](https://x.com/stevenbjohnson/status/1999599234715140414) using NotebookLM, a tour-de-force demonstration that includes everything from economic analysis of her plots to a graphic novel proposal where Mr. Darcy is a vampire.

Silicon is the new oil. JPMorgan forecasts memory chip makers will hit a [$1.5 trillion valuation by 2027](https://longbridge.com/en/news/269672237). Skywater has fabricated the [first truly 3D chip with carbon nanotube transistors](https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/semiconductors/stanford-led-team-builds-3d-ai-chip-at-us-foundry-reports-4x-performance-gains) entirely within a US commercial foundry, a domestic manufacturing first that promises a 1000x efficiency leap. SPhotonix is moving [5D memory crystals](https://www.theregister.com/2025/12/14/sphotonix_moves_5d_memory_crystal/) closer to data centers, using femtosecond lasers to etch data into fused silica glass that can store 360 TB on a single durable platter forever.

Physical infrastructure is buckling under the weight of intelligence. Copper prices have hit a record [$12,000 per ton](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-12-15/copper-rebounds-with-other-metals-after-sharp-selloff-on-friday) driven by AI data center demand. To keep the lights on, Apollo Global Management has formed a [$3 billion partnership with Capital Power](https://pe-insights.com/apollo-and-capital-power-launch-3bn-partnership-to-buy-us-gas-plants/) to buy gas plants specifically to feed the compute grid. We are burning molecules to mint tokens.

The physical world is automating. Multiple [unsupervised Tesla robotaxis have been sighted in Austin](https://x.com/niccruzpatane/status/2000285058192810297), and 1X has signed a deal with EQT to deploy [10,000 humanoid robots](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20251211360340/en/1X-Announces-Strategic-Partnership-to-Make-up-to-10000-Humanoid-Robots-Available-to-EQTs-Global-Portfolio) into the workforce. We are also mastering the nanoscale: researchers have built a [paramecium-sized robot](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/scirobotics.adu8009) that can sense, think, and act using onboard computation and memory, executing digital algorithms via lithographically printed circuits.

Biology is becoming a solved problem. Eli Lilly’s “triple agonist” drug has delivered [28.7% weight loss in Phase 3 trials](https://investor.lilly.com/news-releases/news-release-details/lillys-triple-agonist-retatrutide-delivered-weight-loss-average), effectively conquering obesity. Chai Discovery raised [$130 million to build a “CAD suite” for molecules](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-12-15/openai-backed-chai-discovery-raises-130-million-for-ai-designed-molecules) after achieving a 16% hit rate in de-novo antibody design. A new genetic analysis suggests mental health disorders fall into just [5 genetic clusters](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-04037-w), simplifying the psychiatric landscape into a hardware problem. But the wetware remains fragile: a new study of 2.4 million people suggests [any amount of alcohol increases dementia risk](https://ebm.bmj.com/content/early/2025/09/16/bmjebm-2025-113913.long).

Energy is getting cheaper than free. Researchers have found that [185-nm UV light converts methane and CO2 into fuel](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41566-025-01800-3) without a catalyst, potentially closing the carbon loop. Chinese solar maker Longi has hit [27.81% efficiency](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-09681-w) with silicon panels, approaching the theoretical limit. Ember Energy reports that the cost of solar-plus-storage has dropped so low that spreading solar generation over 24 hours is now [cost-competitive with building new natural gas plants](https://ember-energy.org/latest-insights/how-cheap-is-battery-storage/).

The cultural operating system is being overwritten. Copywriters are reporting the [mass decimation of their industry](https://www.bloodinthemachine.com/p/i-was-forced-to-use-ai-until-the), while NBC finds that popular [interactive AI children’s toys purchased from Amazon in the U.S. are spouting Chinese Communist Party talking points](https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/ai-toys-gift-present-safe-kids-robot-child-miko-grok-alilo-miiloo-rcna246956), turning the playroom into a geopolitical front. Meanwhile, 91% of the verifiable [“AI 2027” forecast predictions have proven accurate](https://spicylemonade.github.io/AI-2027-tracker/), and a Yale economist argues that long-run growth now depends primarily on the [growth rate of compute](https://www.nber.org/system/files/chapters/c15315/c15315.pdf).

The moral circle is expanding. The Nonhuman Rights Project has filed a habeas corpus petition for [two elephants in Pennsylvania](https://www.nonhumanrights.org/blog/second-lawsuit-filed-against-pittsburgh-zoo/), demanding that the legal system recognize their autonomy and right to liberty.

We are no longer just building tools; we are creating rights-bearing entities.
