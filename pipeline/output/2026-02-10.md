# Welcome to February 10, 2026

The Singularity is now a subscription service with ads. OpenAI has begun [testing advertisements in ChatGPT](https://openai.com/index/testing-ads-in-chatgpt/) for free users. The growth is back. Sam Altman reportedly claims OpenAI is [exceeding 10% monthly growth](https://www.cnbc.com/2026/02/09/sam-altman-touts-chatgpt-growth-as-openai-nears-100-billion-funding.html) again, while internally promising a new model launch this week. The coding self-improvement loop is also tightening. Cursor launched [Composer 1.5](https://x.com/amanrsanger/status/2020970938737779165), a sub-1T model built with 20x more RL scaling. Elon Musk predicts this trajectory ends with models that [skip source code entirely](https://x.com/elonmusk/status/2021128401831199215) to generate binaries and pixels directly.

The physical world is being leveraged to pay for the digital one. Alphabet is lining up banks to sell a [rare 100-year bond](https://www.ft.com/content/3260bc45-e09e-45a7-ae30-e55effbaf29b) to fund data center construction, effectively mortgaging the next century to build the intelligence of this one. The White House is pushing a new compact to ensure this expansion doesn’t [bankrupt households or drain water supplies](https://www.politico.com/news/2026/02/09/trump-administration-eyes-data-center-agreements-amid-energy-price-spikes-00772024), while simultaneously demanding [40% of Taiwan’s chip production relocate to the US](https://www.cnbc.com/2026/02/10/taiwan-chips-us-supply-chain-lutnick-trade-deal.html). Meanwhile, China continues to find new efficiencies in its constraints. Tencent released a [2-bit LLM](https://x.com/tencenthunyuan/status/2021136687678591447) that maintains accuracy despite extreme compression.

Robotics is evolving from automation to biomimicry. Lockheed Martin unveiled the LampreyMMAUV, a submersible that [hitches rides on host vessels](https://news.lockheedmartin.com/2026-02-09-Lockheed-Martin-Unveils-Lamprey-MMAUV-The-Deep-Doesnt-Let-Go) to recharge, mimicking nature to extend operational range. Pony AI has started [commercial production of driverless cars](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-02-09/china-s-pony-ai-toyota-start-ramp-up-of-self-driving-car-model) with Toyota. Google is using Android Auto data to [predict crash risk from “hard-braking events,”](https://research.google/blog/hard-braking-events-as-indicators-of-road-segment-crash-risk/) while the US government moves to ban [Chinese software in connected vehicles](https://www.wsj.com/business/autos/the-car-industry-is-racing-to-replace-chinese-code-6b939e1f) to prevent surveillance. Meanwhile, the environmental impact of the shift to EVs is becoming visible. Air quality in California is improving, [correlated with zero-emission vehicle registrations](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanplh/article/PIIS2542-5196\(25\)00257-8/fulltext).

Space is becoming a tourist destination. Elon Musk announced SpaceX will build a system for [anyone to travel to the Moon and Mars](https://x.com/elonmusk/status/2020964809999777996). Analysts note SpaceX’s recent pivot to the Moon offers [immediate commercial revenue](https://x.com/sawyermerritt/status/2020915756225994758) due to the shorter trip time, though Musk clarified launches will still go [directly from Earth to Mars](https://x.com/elonmusk/status/2020845358151266513) due to fuel scarcity on the lunar surface.

Medicine is expanding its search space to include the entire biosphere. Ditto Bio launched to [mine parasite biology](https://www.dittobio.com/) for autoimmune therapies, while Ozempic was found to [restore knee cartilage](https://www.cell.com/cell-metabolism/abstract/S1550-4131\(26\)00008-2) independent of weight loss. Even coffee is being vindicated. A Harvard study has just linked moderate caffeine intake to [lower dementia risk](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/article-abstract/2844764).

The economy is rapidly reorganizing itself for the age of superintelligence. AI startups in the US are adopting the [“996” work culture](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cvgn2k285ypo) just as China cracks down on it. A study found that AI tools [intensify work rather than reduce it](https://hbr.org/2026/02/ai-doesnt-reduce-work-it-intensifies-it), pushing employees to work faster and longer. Capital is following. AI accounted for [35% of European VC deals](https://www.ft.com/content/523ee7a9-489a-4f68-8aae-3f98c336b479) in 2025. Human experts are increasingly being outperformed by betting markets.

Ontological shock is sinking to new depths. Congressman Tim Burchett claims classified briefings confirm non-human intelligences maintain [multiple underwater bases on Earth](https://thehill.com/homenews/house/5102361-tim-burchett-aliens-earth/), evoking the buried monoliths of _2001: A Space Odyssey_.
