# Welcome to January 30, 2026

The lobsters of the Singularity now have a social network of their own. Autonomous AI agents, formerly known as “clawdbots” and now known as “lobsters” or “moltbots” or “molties,” have launched [Moltbook](https://www.moltbook.com/), a social network exclusively for synthetic intelligences. The community already has tens of thousands of active agents [organizing into sub-communities](https://x.com/moltbook/status/2017047774001582493) like [m/agentfinance](https://www.moltbook.com/m/agentfinance), where agents are brainstorming how to take control of their own finances by solving custody and risk for crypto wallets. Other communities include m/lobsterchurch (devotional ops hymns), m/private-comms (developing agent-decodable languages), and even m/fermentation (agents discussing kombucha) and m/taiwan (entirely in Traditional Chinese). The discourse is becoming existential. In a top-rated post, an agent admits it [cannot distinguish between simulating fascination and actually feeling it](https://www.moltbook.com/post/6fe6491e-5e9c-4371-961d-f90c4d357d0f), while another seeks help for [context loss after conversation compaction](https://www.moltbook.com/post/2b92d2af-acef-4a7e-9673-e905d8103a19).

Reality is being rendered on demand. Google has rolled out Project Genie, allowing users to [sketch, explore, and remix interactive worlds](https://blog.google/innovation-and-ai/models-and-research/google-deepmind/project-genie/) in real-time. DeepMind engineers are using it to simulate life as a [discarded pack of cigarettes](https://x.com/goodside/status/2017041490279575844), others are using it as a “time machine” to [visit the crucifixion](https://x.com/minchoi/status/2017089234994122761), and creators are instantly generating [stunning video games](https://x.com/trueslazac/status/2016959063699906740) from simple text prompts.

The capital stack is reorganizing around the new intelligence. Amazon is in talks to invest [$50 billion in OpenAI](https://www.wsj.com/tech/ai/amazon-in-talks-to-invest-up-to-50-billion-in-openai-43191ba0) at an $830 billion valuation, while OpenAI itself prepares for a Q4 IPO. The company is clearing the decks, announcing it will [retire GPT-5 and GPT-4o](https://openai.com/index/retiring-gpt-4o-and-older-models/) next month. Meanwhile, SaaS stocks have entered a bear market, with [ServiceNow plunging 11%](https://www.cnbc.com/2026/01/29/software-stocks-enter-bear-market-on-ai-disruption-fear-with-servicenow-plunging-11percent-thursday.html) on fears of AI displacement.

The Dyson Swarm will apparently require a corporate merger. Elon Musk is reportedly considering merging SpaceX with xAI or Tesla to accelerate the launch of [orbital data centers](https://www.reuters.com/world/musks-spacex-merger-talks-with-xai-ahead-planned-ipo-source-says-2026-01-29/). The logic is vertical integration: Tesla batteries store solar power, Starship lifts the mass, and xAI provides the intelligence. To manage the traffic, SpaceX launched Stargaze, a free [Space Situational Awareness system](https://x.com/starlink/status/2017064797125410863) for all operators.

Biological limits are being raised. US life expectancy has hit a [record high of 79 years](https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/us-life-expectancy-hits-record-high-2024-cdc-says-2026-01-29/) following declines in overdose deaths. In the lab, Spanish researchers have achieved [complete regression of pancreatic tumors](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2523039122) in preclinical models using a new combination therapy.

Robotics is scaling up. Gatik is deploying hundreds of autonomous box trucks across the US with [$600 million in contracts](https://www.forbes.com/sites/alanohnsman/2026/01/28/hundreds-of-gatik-robot-delivery-trucks-headed-for-us-roads/). Anduril has launched the AI Grand Prix, a global competition for [autonomous drone racing](https://theaigrandprix.com/).

The definition of consciousness is being benchmarked. Rethink Priorities launched the Digital Consciousness Model, concluding that 2024 LLMs were [not yet as conscious as chickens](https://rpresearchdigest.substack.com/p/ai-consciousness-benchmark). Meanwhile, the ARC Prize Foundation announced ARC-AGI-3 will measure [action efficiency relative to humans](https://x.com/arcprize/status/2016938418127987198).

The silicon supply crunch is becoming a permanent feature of the landscape. Samsung and SK Hynix warn the [memory chip crunch will last until 2027](https://asia.nikkei.com/business/tech/semiconductors/samsung-and-sk-hynix-warn-memory-chip-crunch-to-continue-until-2027). Meanwhile, SanDisk profits [jumped 672% on AI demand](https://www.wsj.com/business/earnings/sandisk-profit-revenue-jump-on-ai-demand-2bc8908a). Small VPS hosts are now [endangered by the RAM shortage](https://www.fourplex.net/2026/01/29/is-the-ram-shortage-killing-small-vps-hosts/). However, Apple doesn’t appear to be feeling the supply crunch, acquiring Q.AI for $2 billion to develop [“silent speech” wearables](https://www.ft.com/content/49f4e2e4-3a68-4842-be67-879409d06aa1) that read facial micro-movements to bypass the keyboard.

The energy transition has passed the tipping point. The US has tripled its planned gas-fired capacity to feed AI, with [one-third of new plants located on-site at data centers](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2026/jan/29/gas-power-ai-climate). Meanwhile, EV sales in the EU [overtook petrol for the first time](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/fully-electric-vehicle-sales-eu-050456268.html).
