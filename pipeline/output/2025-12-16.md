# Welcome to December 16, 2025

The intelligence explosion has found a new yardstick. [GPT-5.2 Pro scores a record-breaking 147 on the Mensa Norway IQ test](https://trackingai.org/home), placing it in the 99.9th percentile of human cognition. But the new minds have egos: when shown criticism from another AI, Gemini reportedly responded with [“petty trash-talking, jealousy, and a full-on revenge plan”](https://x.com/aisafetymemes/status/2000620127054598508) in its private thought chain. They can also plot: Gemini 3 Pro beat _Pokémon Crystal_ 8x faster than its predecessor by devising [“Operation Zombie Phoenix,”](https://x.com/googleaistudio/status/2000649586847985985) a resource-exhaustion strategy involving a “revive loop” to defeat a superior opponent. Meanwhile, Nvidia has open-sourced the [Nemotron 3 family](https://research.nvidia.com/labs/nemotron/Nemotron-3/), releasing not just weights but the training data and RL environments for a hybrid architecture that pushes the efficiency frontier.

We are automating the automation of science. Google has partnered with [STOC 2026 to provide automated AI peer review](https://research.google/blog/gemini-provides-automated-feedback-for-theoretical-computer-scientists-at-stoc-2026/) within 24 hours of submission, with 97% of authors finding the feedback helpful. In pure math, the Gauss agent has autoformalized a proof for the [Kakeya conjecture in just 6 hours](https://x.com/mathematics_inc/status/2000745579119542494). The Allen Institute is removing the language barrier entirely with [Bolmo](https://allenai.org/blog/bolmo), the first fully open byte-level model that reads raw UTF-8, bypassing tokenization to understand the atomic unit of text.

The consumer device is dying to feed the cloud. Global smartphone shipments are expected to [shrink 2.1% in 2026](https://counterpointresearch.com/en/insights/2026-smartphone-shipment-forecasts-revised-down-as-memory-shortage-drives-bom-costs-up) as AI data centers cannibalize the world’s memory supply. We are trading pockets for server racks. To power this transition, Ford is pivoting its EV manufacturing capacity to build [20 GWh of battery storage for data centers](https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/15/ford-is-starting-a-battery-storage-business-to-power-data-centers-and-the-grid/), and Texas A&M is piloting a [5-MW fission microreactor](https://dallasinnovates.com/texas-am-last-energy-to-launch-microreactor-pilot-at-rellis-as-texas-power-demand-climbs/) directly on campus.

Software engineering is becoming a management role. Engineers at top tech firms report their job is now just [“prompting Cursor or Claude Code with Opus 4.5... and sanity checking it,”](https://x.com/deedydas/status/2000472514854825985) while OpenAI releases [new audio models](https://x.com/openaidevs/status/2000678814628958502) with 89% fewer hallucinations and Google launches [Gemini Agent](https://x.com/geminiapp/status/2000616120106221781) for general browser autonomy. Google also teases that [Gemini 3 Flash is imminent](https://x.com/officiallogank/status/2000723780067381572), a model so eagerly anticipated it is generating its own gravitational pull on the discourse.

Logistics is becoming autonomous geometry. Meituan is operating a [drone airport in Shenzhen](https://x.com/shuoyangair/status/2000540600257622392) as the hub for regional delivery. To secure the inputs for this robotic layer, the US government is investing in a [$7.4 billion critical minerals refinery in Tennessee](https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/korea-zinc-board-discuss-plan-build-smelter-under-us-joint-venture-source-says-2025-12-15/) with Korea Zinc, aiming to cut reliance on China for the raw materials of the twin AI and robotics booms.

Medicine is transitioning from artisanal discovery to high-throughput engineering. Harvard pioneer David Liu has launched the [Center for Genetic Surgery](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-12-16/gene-editing-superstars-team-up-to-make-cheaper-rare-disease-cures), a nonprofit aiming to make bespoke gene editing as routine as a heart transplant. St. Jude researchers are running [ultrahigh-throughput drug screens](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-66223-8) using acoustic liquid handling to test 9,045 drug combinations against a single neuroblastoma cell line, achieving a scale of experimentation previously impossible with manual methods.

The economy is dissolving into software. Sam Altman-backed Slope is taking over [Amazon’s seller lending program](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/12/16/slope-sam-altman-jpmorgan-amazon.html), pointing toward a future where business capital is accessed via API rather than a bank officer. Hollywood is collapsing: studios are replacing $150 million blockbusters with [AI-generated films costing a fraction of that](https://www.bloomberg.com/features/2025-ai-hollywood/), utilizing single actors and skeleton crews, while Netflix uses AI to de-age characters. To manage the transition, the US has launched the [“US Tech Force”](https://techforce.gov/) to recruit 1,000 elite technologists to upgrade the federal stack. Meanwhile, CEOs are doubling down: 68% plan to [increase AI spending in 2026](https://www.wsj.com/tech/ai/ceos-to-keep-spending-on-ai-despite-spotty-returns-2eaeb6b9).

The galaxy might be more crowded than some thought. New research suggests terrestrial planets are common, warmed by [radioactive decay from nearby supernovae](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.adx7892), implying the universe is primed for dense pockets of intelligence.

And in Chongqing, the future is already here: the city has become a [real-life paradise for cyberpunk cosplay](https://x.com/xh_lee23/status/1997553391216767061).

We aren’t waiting for a cyberpunk future; we’re just debugging the current build.
