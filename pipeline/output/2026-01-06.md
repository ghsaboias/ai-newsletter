# Welcome to January 6, 2026

The hardware substrate of the Singularity is scaling asymptotically. Nvidia has announced its next-generation Vera Rubin GPU platform is now in [full production](https://nvidianews.nvidia.com/news/rubin-platform-ai-supercomputer), delivering 50 petaflops of NVFP4 compute and a 10x reduction in inference costs, with Elon Musk confirming he will have the GPUs [operating “at scale” in just 9 months](https://x.com/elonmusk/status/2008337257082622287). The simulation layer is also deepening. Nvidia’s DLSS 4.5 now uses a [2nd-gen transformer model](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/news/dlss-4-5-dynamic-multi-frame-gen-6x-2nd-gen-transformer-super-res/) to generate five frames for every rendered one, enabling 240+ FPS path tracing. The competition is responding. AMD previewed its MI500 GPUs (2-nm process) for 2027, projecting a [1,000x increase in AI performance](https://ir.amd.com/news-events/press-releases/detail/1272/amd-and-its-partners-share-their-vision-for-ai-everywhere-for-everyone-at-ces-2026), while simultaneously launching the Ryzen AI 400 Series for the edge, which boasts [1.3x faster multitasking](https://ir.amd.com/news-events/press-releases/detail/1270/amd-expands-ai-leadership-across-client-graphics-and-software-with-new-ryzen-ryzen-ai-and-amd-rocm-announcements-at-ces-2026). Meanwhile, Intel has officially launched Core Ultra Series 3, the first chips built on the [Intel 18A process](https://www.intc.com/news-events/press-releases/detail/1757/ces-2026-intel-core-ultra-series-3-debuts-as-first-built) manufactured in the United States.

Matter is becoming a programmable API. Lego has unveiled the “Smart Brick,” a standard 2x4 block containing a 4.1-mm ASIC and [local “BrickNet” mesh networking](https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/lego-unveils-a-technology-packed-smart-brick-at-ces-2026-190000511.html), effectively releasing programmable matter to children. At the industrial scale, the humanoid workforce is coming online: Hyundai plans to deploy [30,000 next-gen Atlas robots annually](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-01-05/hyundai-unveils-new-humanoid-robot-to-work-in-its-car-factories) by 2028, now powered by [Google DeepMind’s Gemini Robotics models](https://bostondynamics.com/blog/boston-dynamics-google-deepmind-form-new-ai-partnership/), while Qualcomm has partnered with Figure to put its new [Dragonwing IQ10 processors](https://www.qualcomm.com/news/releases/2026/01/qualcomm-introduces-a-full-suite-of-robotics-technologies-power) inside the next wave of androids. Domestic life is also being automated. LG introduced CLOiD, a home robot built on [visual-language-action (VLA) models](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/lg-electronics-presents-lg-cloid-home-robot-to-demonstrate-zero-labor-home-at-ces-2026-302652192.html) aimed at the “Zero Labor Home.”

The streets are being indexed by silicon. Nvidia has dedicated [20% of its workforce (7,000 people)](https://x.com/BenBajarin/status/2008296697248588118) to autonomous vehicles and released the [Alpamayo open-source reasoning models](https://nvidianews.nvidia.com/news/alpamayo-autonomous-vehicle-development) to solve long-tail driving edge cases. Mercedes-Benz is already testing Nvidia’s [point-to-point Level 2 system](https://www.theverge.com/news/852880/nvidia-autonomous-driving-demo-tesla-fsd) as a direct answer to Tesla FSD. Simultaneously, Lucid, Nuro, and Uber have unveiled their [joint robotaxi fleet](https://media.lucidmotors.com/en/newsitem/1061-lucid-nuro-and-uber-unveil-global-robotaxi-at-ces-announce-autonomous-on-road-testing) for the Bay Area.

While hardware scales, the marginal cost of software is collapsing to zero. Elon Musk agrees that [“all software is about to be free,”](https://x.com/elonmusk/status/2008279850327376372) a shift driving potentially imminent hyperdeflation in the sector. Engineers warn that “vibe coding” is now [“quietly dying”](https://x.com/thevixhal/status/2008126866776060263) because Claude Code can one-shot two-month projects in minutes. The application layer, in turn, is dissolving. Microsoft is [redesigning its Edge web browser to function as a Copilot app](https://www.windowscentral.com/microsoft/windows-11/microsoft-is-slowly-turning-edge-into-another-copilot-app-tests-redesigned-ui-that-takes-inspiration-from-copilot), and Jeff Dean-backed BenchFlow has introduced [SkillsBench](https://github.com/benchflow-ai/SkillsBench) to more strictly audit agent performance. Media is also becoming generative. Google’s Veo video model is coming to TVs, allowing users to [generate media on demand](https://blog.google/products/google-tv/ces-2026/). AMD CEO Lisa Su predicts [5 billion people will use AI daily](https://x.com/stocksavvyshay/status/2008372536896348501) within five years.

The energy grid is being privatized by compute. xAI has purchased [five 380-MW gas turbines](https://x.com/semianalysis_/status/2008327656840831189) to power a new cluster, while Crusoe is now hosting Nvidia GB200s in Iceland [powered by geothermal energy](https://x.com/crusoeai/status/2008327538985308623). As [NIMBYism forces AI data centers out of neighborhoods,](https://apnews.com/article/data-centers-artificial-intelligence-nimby-tech-21fa7b957664d5dca6788e35ab43b88e) developers are increasingly looking to space-based deployment. On the supply side, the DOE awarded [$2.7 billion to jumpstart domestic uranium enrichment](https://www.energy.gov/articles/us-department-energy-awards-27-billion-restore-american-uranium-enrichment), and Foxconn reports revenue is up [26.4% driven by AI demand](https://www.reuters.com/world/china/foxconns-q4-revenue-surges-2207-year-earlier-ai-demand-2026-01-05/). Storage is catching up: Donut Lab introduced a solid-state battery that charges in [5 minutes](https://www.donutlab.com/ces-battery-announcement/), and CATL is deploying [sodium-ion batteries at commercial scale](https://chargedevs.com/newswire/catl-to-deploy-sodium-ion-ev-batteries-at-commercial-scale-in-2026/) this year.

Reality is being patched. Australian researchers are developing a [CRISPR Cas13 nasal spray](https://www.wired.com/story/crispr-flu-antivirals/) to edit influenza RNA in the lungs, while Portalgraph has demonstrated a [touchable 3D projector](https://x.com/portalgraph/status/2008117315939029117) that injects VR into the real world. Congress has approved a [$24.4 billion NASA budget](https://spacenews.com/minibus-provides-24-4-billion-for-nasa-for-fiscal-year-2026/) with a new $250 million appropriation for nuclear fission on the moon. The economy is adapting to this volatility: Parcl and Polymarket are launching [real estate prediction markets](https://parcl.co/blog/parcl-x-polymarket-launch-real-estate-prediction-markets), and Bosch is investing [$2.9 billion in AI while cutting 13,000 jobs](https://www.wsj.com/tech/ai/bosch-to-invest-2-9-billion-in-ai-over-next-couple-of-years-83d6b4f8).

Did you think the Singularity was just vibes?
