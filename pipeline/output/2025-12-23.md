# Welcome to December 23, 2025

The monopoly on frontier cognition has dissolved into a mere six-month latency. Chinese startup Zhipu AI has released [GLM-4.7, an open-weight model that tops GPT-5.2 in WebDev Arena](https://lmarena.ai/leaderboard/webdev) and breaks the [73% barrier on SWE-bench](https://x.com/deedydas/status/2003300941341295004), trailing the closed frontier by half a year. This timeline is hardening into a standard; Epoch AI confirms that [leading open-weight Chinese models lag the FrontierMath Tiers 1-3 edge by approximately seven months](https://x.com/epochairesearch/status/2003178174310678644). Simultaneously, architectures are getting leaner. Researchers have unveiled [“Universal Reasoning Models,” which achieve a pass@1 score of 40% on ARC-AGI-1](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14693) with only one-eighth the parameters of standard Transformers and substantially better performance, proving that massive scale is not the only path to competence. However, the price of agency is sticky; analysis suggests the [“hourly” cost of agents at the METR 50% autonomy time horizon is increasing](https://www.tobyord.com/writing/hourly-costs-for-ai-agents), creating immense pressure to optimize the inference stack.

The distinction between natural language and executable code is evaporating. Microsoft has set a “North Star” goal to [eliminate every line of C and C++ from its codebase by 2030](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/galenh_principal-software-engineer-coreai-microsoft-activity-7407863239289729024-WTzf/), aiming for a velocity where a single engineer can rewrite 1 million lines of code in a month. The tools are ready: [Claude Code now supports the Language Server Protocol](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md) for deep editor integration, and YouTube has launched a [no-code Playables Builder](https://www.youtube.com/playablesbuilder/) that lets creators generate games via prompts. The military is also upgrading its stack; the US War Department has [officially partnered with xAI](https://www.war.gov/News/Releases/Release/Article/4366573/the-war-department-to-expand-ai-arsenal-on-genaimil-with-xai/) to deploy advanced models on GenAI.mil.

The thermodynamic footprint of compute is becoming a planetary feature. A heat-seeking satellite from SatVu has captured [waste heat from a 700-MW Bitcoin mine in Rockdale, Texas, visible from orbit](https://www.space.com/space-exploration/satellites/satellites-reveal-heat-leaking-from-largest-us-cryptocurrency-mining-center). To feed this hunger without boiling the atmosphere, Alphabet is [buying clean energy developer Intersect Power for $4.75 billion](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-12-22/alphabet-to-buy-data-center-partner-intersect-for-4-75-billion), securing a pipeline of 15+ gigawatts. Energy generation itself is breaking century-old paradigms: China has activated [Chaotan One, the first commercial power generator using supercritical carbon dioxide](https://interestingengineering.com/energy/worlds-first-sco2-based-power-generator-china) instead of steam, while BYD charging stations can now [add 400 km of range to EVs in just 5 minutes](https://x.com/dominictsz/status/2003013638588682399).

Biology is being repurposed as a manufacturing substrate. In a display of “3D necroprinting,” researchers are using [female mosquito proboscides as high-resolution printing nozzles](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.adw9953), achieving line widths of 20 microns to print bioscaffolds. Robots are also invading the public sphere; in Shenzhen, [machines are riding the subway alone to make deliveries](https://x.com/dominictsz/status/2003226289776549949). Physical Intelligence’s agents are winning gold medals at the [“Robot Olympics” for tasks like spreading peanut butter and unlocking doors](https://www.pi.website/blog/olympics), simply by fine-tuning VLA models. But safety is an open question: with 1 million robots expected soon, the industry is [abandoning the “big red button” standard](https://www.theinformation.com/articles/robot-makers-wrestle-safely-pull-plug-humanoids) in favor of probabilistic failure limits, acknowledging that physically stopping a humanoid is no longer viable.

Mind is solving matter. Researchers have used [neural networks to directly solve the Kohn-Sham equation](https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/wl9w-8g8r), optimizing the ground state of density functional theory, while others are using AI to [simulate rare biomolecular events like lipid flip-flops](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-67599-3) that were previously invisible to dynamics simulations.

The radical experiments of the frontier are graduating into the insured infrastructure of the establishment. In the financial sector, Palmer Luckey’s [Erebor Bank has secured FDIC approval](https://www.fdic.gov/news/press-releases/2025/fdic-approves-deposit-insurance-application-erebor-bank-na-columbus-ohio), effectively bringing the crypto market under federal insurance protection. Even talent is finding its equilibrium; [20% of Google’s AI hires this year are “boomerangs,”](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/12/19/google-boomerang-year-20percent-ai-software-devs-hired-2025-ex-employees.html) returning to the fold as the industry consolidates around the winners.

The state is asserting dominion over the z-axis. The US government is considering [granting SpaceX nearly 800 acres to expand Starbase](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/12/23/climate/spacex-land-exchange-texas.html), solidifying the physical gateway to orbit as Starlink [surpasses 9 million customers](https://x.com/sawyermerritt/status/2003269866443165887) with customer acquisition accelerating by 49% month-over-month. Simultaneously, the airspace is being locked down; the FCC has [banned all new foreign-made drones](https://www.politico.com/news/2025/12/22/fcc-drone-ban-dji-00703742) to inoculate the homeland against surveillance.

The healing process is becoming incisionless and oral. Novo Nordisk has secured a landmark victory with the [approval of the first oral pill version of Wegovy](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/12/22/fda-approves-first-glp-1-pill-for-obesity-from-novo-nordisk.html), fundamentally altering the logistics of mass-scale weight loss and healthspan extension by replacing the needle with a daily tablet starting in January. Meanwhile, HistoSonics is preparing to [launch trials for treating pancreatic cancer with histotripsy](https://spectrum.ieee.org/ultrasound-cancer-treatment), using ultrasound cavitation to destroy tumors without a knife.

We are finally paying down the technical debt of evolution.
