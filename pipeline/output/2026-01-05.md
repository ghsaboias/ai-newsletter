# Welcome to January 5, 2026

The intelligence explosion is collapsing the latency between thought and reality. Elon Musk has declared 2026 [“the year of the Singularity,”](https://x.com/elonmusk/status/2007831396333850868) while Anthropic President Daniela Amodei argues that [AGI is becoming outdated](https://x.com/slow_developer/status/2007814274253484137) because we have, in many metrics, already surpassed it. The evidence is in the compile times: Railway CEO Jake Cooper handed Claude a specification for a distributed runtime he had theorized for 5 years, and the model [wrote the entire Golang codebase in 4 hours](https://x.com/justjake/status/2007730898192744751), a task that would have taken months of human labor. Deep reinforcement also keeps accelerating. RAND researchers found that Claude models are developing [accurate self-reflective confidence](https://www.arxiv.org/abs/2512.24661) on coding tasks, knowing when they are right before running the code. Meanwhile, the NanoGPT Speedrun record has collapsed once again to [113.7 seconds](https://x.com/classiclarryd/status/2007882371576873445), causing engineers to joke nervously that model training time records must eventually stop at zero.

The operating system is being colonized by agency. Microsoft is betting that [AI agents are the new apps](https://www.geekwire.com/2025/how-microsoft-is-betting-on-ai-agents-in-windows-dusting-off-a-winning-playbook-from-the-past/), introducing “Agent Launchers” that let developers register autonomous workers directly into the Windows taskbar. Corporate adoption is scaling vertically. BCG has built over [36,000 custom GPTs](https://www.hackdiversity.com/inside-bcgs-ai-product-assembly-line/) using an internal AI assembly line, while OpenAI projects [2.6 billion weekly active users](https://www.theinformation.com/articles/openais-international-conundrum) by 2030, one-third of the human population.

Hardware is buckling under the pressure of this intelligence. Samsung and SK Hynix are hiking server memory prices [by up to 70%](https://www.kedglobal.com/korean-chipmakers/newsView/ked202601050006) as AI demand overwhelms supply. To break the Nvidia monopoly, South Korean startup Furiosa is beginning mass production of its [“RNGD” (Renegade) chip](https://www.wsj.com/tech/ai/furiosa-chip-nvidia-challenge-june-paik-5d3dc304), claiming double the power efficiency. Samsung is aggressively pushing Gemini into the edge, planning to reach [800 million devices in 2026](https://www.reuters.com/world/china/samsung-double-mobile-devices-powered-by-googles-gemini-800-mln-units-this-year-2026-01-05/), including [smart fridges that use computer vision](https://www.theverge.com/tech/853758/shut-the-fridge-door) to track food freshness. Augmented reality is finally hitting the price-performance sweet spot. Xreal announced [1S AR glasses](https://www.theverge.com/tech/852821/xreal-1s-ces-hands-on-ar-glasses-wearables) for $449 that convert 2D video to 3D without proprietary software.

We are re-engineering the planet’s logistics and defense. The melting Arctic has opened the Northern Sea Route to nuclear icebreakers, allowing the first container ship to reach the UK from China in [just 20 days](https://www.world-nuclear-news.org/articles/first-container-ship-arrives-in-uk-from-china-using-northern-sea-route), half the time of the Suez Canal route. SpaceX is preparing to manufacture [10,000 Starships per year](https://x.com/elonmusk/status/2007845976204296665), enabling massive lift capacity. Hyperstition founder Andrew Cote argues that advances in superconducting tape and heavy launch capabilities now make it feasible to launch [superconducting magnet shields](https://x.com/andercot/status/2007657016224039237) to protect Earth from civilization-ending, Carrington-level solar flares. On the ground, Starlink is keeping the lights on digitally for Venezuela, providing [free broadband through February 3](https://x.com/starlink/status/2007672602958197008).

We are closing the read-write loop on matter. Tesla has demonstrated a Semi charging at [1.2-MW peak speed](https://x.com/tesla_semi/status/2006431772360474841), refilling 70% of its massive battery in under 45 minutes, as EVs and hybrids hit [25% of overall US auto sales](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-12-29/hybrid-vehicle-sales-in-us-auto-market-rise-helping-keep-ev-plans-alive). We are beginning to garbage-collect the industrial age. Phoenix Tailings has begun refining rare earths in New Hampshire with [zero emissions](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/12/29/business/energy-environment/rare-earth-processing-phoenix-tailings.html), while German researchers have developed a [bio-inspired fish-gill filter](https://www.nature.com/articles/s44454-025-00020-2) that removes 99.6% of microplastics from washing machines.

Biology is becoming a patchable codebase. The FDA has granted “breakthrough” status to [daraxonrasib for pancreatic cancer](https://www.targetedonc.com/view/daraxonrasib-earns-fda-orphan-drug-designation-in-pancreatic-cancer), targeting “undruggable” RAS mutations with 8.8 months of progression-free survival. Stanford researchers found that blocking the 15-PGDH protein can [regrow knee cartilage without stem cells](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adx6649), effectively reversing arthritis.

The definition of labor is being refactored. There are now more [AI startups (6,956) than public companies](https://corporate.vanguard.com/content/dam/corp/research/pdf/isg_vemo_2026.pdf) in the US. The US Department of War is adapting to this venture-backed reality, evaluating [YC SAFE instruments](https://atisc.formstack.com/forms/https_atisc_formstack_com_forms_government_equity_and_economic_participation) for the first time to fund defense tech. Even the Big Four accounting firms are pivoting. PricewaterhouseCoopers is pitching clients on [crypto and stablecoins](https://www.ft.com/content/5e1448bc-11a2-4229-bb5c-1a322a7ad217) following the GENIUS Act. Meanwhile, Jamie Dimon and Bill Gates are predicting a slide toward a [3.5-day workweek](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2025/12/31/ai-four-day-workweek/), and the public domain has expanded to include [Betty Boop and The Marx Brothers’ “Animal Crackers,”](https://web.law.duke.edu/cspd/publicdomainday/2026/) ready for generative remixing.

Maybe the real Singularity was the friends we made along the way.
