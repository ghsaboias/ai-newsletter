# Welcome to January 11, 2026

The Singularity is rapidly becoming the base clock speed of civilization. Epoch AI reports that global AI compute capacity is now [doubling every 7 months](https://x.com/epochairesearch/status/2009757548891852929), a 3.3x annual compounding rate that is obliterating historical trends. This exponential pressure is starting to crack open the hardest problems in mathematics. GPT-5.2 Pro and Aristotle have now [autonomously resolved Erdős problem #729](https://x.com/AcerFur/status/2010054423398232080), confirming that the bulk solution of math is now a function of compute. We are finding that intelligence is often just a function of attention density. Google researchers discovered that simply [repeating a prompt twice](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14982) allows models to “attend” to their own inputs without reasoning, boosting performance at zero generated token cost.

The physical layer of the network is becoming indistinguishable from magic. Duke and MIT researchers have demonstrated “WISE,” a paradigm where [model weights are encoded in radio waves](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.adz0817), allowing devices to compute using the air itself in a manner reminiscent of the Borg Collective. Simultaneously, Sandia National Labs has successfully [mapped the brain’s motor cortex onto Intel’s Loihi 2](https://www.nature.com/articles/s42256-025-01143-2), solving partial differential equations on neuromorphic hardware with biological efficiency. The fabrication bottleneck is also breaking. Dai Nippon Printing has unveiled [nanoimprint lithography templates](https://www.global.dnp/news/detail/20177718_4126.html) capable of 1.4-nm logic, potentially bypassing the EUV monopoly. However, the silicon hunger is real. TrendForce predicts an [“unprecedented” 55% jump in DRAM prices](https://www.cnbc.com/2026/01/10/micron-ai-memory-shortage-hbm-nvidia-samsung.html) this quarter.

Robotics is evolving into a self-sustaining ecosystem. Voltair Labs has launched drones that [recharge directly from power lines](https://www.voltairlabs.com/), effectively giving them infinite range and parasitic autonomy. Defensive kinetics are scaling down to match. Mach Industries introduced “Dart,” a [low-cost anti-drone missile](https://www.machindustries.com/articles/dart) for high-volume interception. On the ground, the Matrix Robotics MATRIX-3 humanoid features [zero-shot learning and soft bionic skin](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dX1IG16Nr1E), while Marc Lore’s Wonder Group is deploying the “Infinite Kitchen,” a robot capable of [500 meals per hour](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2026-01-08/marc-lore-s-wonder-aims-to-transform-restaurants-with-automation). Even transit is automating. Underground, The Boring Company’s Vegas Loop now runs [130 autonomous Teslas](https://x.com/SERobinsonJr/status/2009777996962599314) daily. Meanwhile, in orbit, Canada is considering procuring a [$250M sovereign Arctic satellite network](https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/satellite-eutelsat-starlink-musk-defence-communications-9.7038830), and the ISS is conducting its first [medical evaluation as a result of long-term microgravity exposure](https://www.space.com/live/astronaut-medical-evacuation-on-iss-jan-10-2026).

Biology is transitioning from a legacy codebase to an active development branch. British researchers have [“solved” the genetics of Alzheimer’s](https://www.nature.com/articles/s44400-025-00045-9), identifying APOE mutations as the root of 92% of risk. UC Irvine has engineered an [almost universal polymerase](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41589-025-02124-7) capable of synthesizing “unnatural” nucleotides, effectively unlocking the read/write permissions for life. We are even hacking the sleep state. Bright Minds’ BMB-101 drug [increases REM sleep by 90%](https://www.biospace.com/press-releases/bright-minds-biosciences-announces-positive-topline-results-from-phase-2-clinical-trial-of-bmb-101-in-patients-with-absence-seizures-and-developmental-and-encephalopathic-epilepsies-dee) without extending duration. Meanwhile, opioid deaths have [dropped 43%](https://www.economist.com/united-states/2026/01/08/why-overdose-deaths-are-falling-in-america) due to a fentanyl supply reduction shock.

Human culture is becoming a training run for its synthetic successor. Morgan Stanley reports that 60% of young adults now listen to [3 hours of AI-generated music per week](https://sherwood.news/markets/morgan-stanley-most-gen-zers-and-millennials-in-the-us-listen-to-about-three/). Midjourney’s Niji V7 is advancing [anime video generation](https://x.com/midjourney/status/2009748519133827304), and Grokipedia has already generated [86% of the article count of the English Wikipedia](https://x.com/cb_doge/status/2010213096883994635). The algorithms are rewriting our attention spans. xAI rewrote the X timeline code, resulting in [20% more user time](https://x.com/nikitabier/status/2010072077697794389), while Amazon is deploying agents to [buy products from competitors](https://www.theinformation.com/briefings/amazons-buy-feature-sparks-backlash-small-retailers) on your behalf. Even beauty is programmable. iPolish has unveiled [smart nails that change color in seconds](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uC544dqE4dw).

The financial system is rapidly pricing in the intelligence explosion. Chamath Palihapitiya estimates [$1 trillion in tech billionaire wealth has fled California](https://x.com/chamath/status/2010215459522548184) to avoid retroactive taxation. Capital is rushing into the new stack. Convertible bond issuance hit a [24-year high](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-01-08/ai-spending-boom-fuels-24-year-high-for-convertible-bond-deals) driven by AI infrastructure. Anthropic’s revenue has now grown [10x annually for three consecutive years](https://www.cnbc.com/2026/01/10/anthropic-amodei-siblings-generative-ai.html). The shift is, inevitably, geopolitical. Taiwan’s exports to the US have [surpassed those to China](https://asia.nikkei.com/economy/trade/taiwan-exports-to-us-overtake-those-to-china-on-ai-tech-demand) for the first time in 26 years, driven by AI demand, and the UAE now leads the world with [64% AI workforce adoption](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/corporate-responsibility/topics/AI-Economy-Institute/reports/Global-AI-Adoption-2025/).

The Singularity is simply what happens when the software learns to upgrade its own hardware.
