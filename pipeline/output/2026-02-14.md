# Welcome to February 14, 2026

The Singularity is wearing your face.

The infrastructure of recognition is being built from every direction. Meta plans to add [facial recognition to its Ray-Ban smart glasses](https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/13/meta-plans-to-add-facial-recognition-to-its-smart-glasses-report-claims/) this year under the internal codename "Name Tag," allowing wearers to identify strangers on sight via Meta's AI assistant. An [internal memo](https://www.macrumors.com/2026/02/13/meta-facial-recognition-smart-glasses/) obtained by the New York Times described the current "political tumult" as good timing because civil society groups "would have their resources focused on other concerns." The Department of Homeland Security is also seizing the moment, sending [hundreds of subpoenas](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/13/technology/dhs-anti-ice-social-media.html) to Google, Meta, Reddit, and Discord demanding the identities behind anonymous accounts that track or criticize ICE — and the companies have [complied with some requests](https://www.seattletimes.com/business/homeland-security-wants-social-media-sites-to-expose-anti-ice-accounts/). On the generative end of the identity crisis, ByteDance's Seedance 2.0 produced [deepfake fight scenes between Tom Cruise and Brad Pitt](https://deadline.com/2026/02/seedance-deepfakes-hollywood-studios-copyright-1236718068/) that went viral globally, prompting Disney to fire a [cease-and-desist](https://deadline.com/2026/02/disney-bytedance-cease-and-desist-letter-seedance-ai-video-1236719549/) accusing ByteDance of a "virtual smash-and-grab" of Disney's IP, while SAG-AFTRA condemned the tool for ["disregarding laws, ethics, and consent."](https://www.thewrap.com/industry-news/public-policy-legal/disney-bytedance-seedance-cease-and-desist/)

While Hollywood litigates, China ships. ByteDance's Seed team released [Seed 2.0](https://x.com/scaling01/status/2022570242833064073) today in Pro, Lite, and Mini variants, with the Pro model scoring 88.8 on MathVision and 89.8 on MathVista — outperforming GPT-5.2 and Claude Opus 4.5 on several vision and math benchmarks. Moonshot AI's open-source [Kimi K2.5](https://huggingface.co/moonshotai/Kimi-K2.5) orchestrates up to 100 parallel agents and 1,500 tool calls per session, hitting 96.1% on AIME 2025. Alibaba's RynnBrain and Kuaishou's Kling also launched this week, rounding out what CNBC calls a [big but rocky week for Chinese AI](https://www.cnbc.com/2026/02/14/new-china-ai-models-alibaba-bytedance-seedance-kuaishou-kling.html). As one observer [put it](https://x.com/scaling01/status/2022487264887230815): "China is ahead in AI video gen and you are calling Dario stupid."

The most consequential breakup of the week has nothing to do with Valentine's Day. Microsoft AI CEO Mustafa Suleyman [told the Financial Times](https://fortune.com/2026/02/13/when-will-ai-kill-white-collar-office-jobs-18-months-microsoft-mustafa-suleyman/) his "personal mission" is AI self-sufficiency, confirming development of [MAI-1](https://winbuzzer.com/2026/02/13/microsoft-mustafa-suleyman-ai-self-sufficiency-openai-mai-models-xcxwbn/), a 500-billion-parameter foundation model trained on 15,000 H100s, to end reliance on OpenAI. In the same breath, he predicted "most, if not all" white-collar tasks — law, accounting, marketing, project management — will be [fully automated within 12 to 18 months](https://www.businessinsider.com/microsoft-ai-ceo-mustafa-suleyman-white-collar-tasks-automation-prediction-2026-2). OpenAI is funding the transition with ads, [charging $60 per thousand impressions](https://www.ft.com/content/c9acd1f7-4864-4bd7-9ada-d2e13f05b906) in ChatGPT — matching Netflix's introductory CPM.

Dario Amodei went on Dwarkesh to declare ["we are near the end of the exponential,"](https://www.dwarkesh.com/p/dario-amodei-2) framing AGI as a few years away — "a country of geniuses in a data center." The urgency is paying off commercially. Anthropic's Super Bowl ads — darkly comedic spots where chatbots steer users toward cougar dating sites and height-boosting insoles — have [pushed Claude to No. 7 on the App Store](https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/13/anthropics-super-bowl-ads-mocking-ai-with-ads-helped-push-claudes-app-into-the-top-10/), with downloads up 32% to 49,200 per day. The tagline — "Ads are coming to AI. But not to Claude" — landed just as OpenAI began [testing advertisements in free-tier ChatGPT](https://openai.com/index/testing-ads-in-chatgpt/), and [CNBC data](https://www.cnbc.com/2026/02/13/anthropic-open-ai-super-bowl-ads.html) shows an 11% jump in Claude's daily active users.

The battlefield is going conversational. OpenAI has been [tapped for voice control](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-02-13/openai-tapped-for-voice-control-tech-in-us-drone-swarm-challenge) in a DARPA drone swarm trial, translating commanders' spoken orders into digital instructions for autonomous drone fleets. The hardware to power both the drones and the models keeps scaling. TSMC approved a record [$45 billion capex for 2026](https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/semiconductors/tsmcs-board-approves-usd45-billion-spending-package-on-new-fabs-record-sign-off-signals-aggressive-expansion-to-grow-capacity), with [$165 billion pledged](https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/u-s-government-plans-tariff-exemptions-for-tsmc-if-it-follows-through-on-american-investment-usd165-billion-already-pledged-to-increase-production-capacity-but-details-of-the-deal-are-still-murky) for US expansion in exchange for tariff exemptions. But the bottleneck is no longer silicon — it's watts. Bloomberg reports a [50% surge in AI-driven power demand](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2026-02-14/ai-battle-turbocharged-by-50-power-demand-surge-new-economy), and the US faces a [175 GW capacity shortfall by 2033](https://introl.com/blog/us-grid-capacity-crisis-175-gw-shortfall-federal-response-2026) — equivalent to 130 million homes.

SpaceX launched [Crew-12 to the ISS](https://www.space.com/news/live/spacex-nasa-crew-12-astronauts-launch-to-iss-feb-13-2026) and landed the Falcon 9 booster at the new LZ-40 recovery pad, with a [Valentine's Day Starlink launch](https://www.vcstar.com/story/news/local/california/2026/02/13/valentines-day-rocket-launch-vandenberg/88639527007/) scheduled from Vandenberg. xAI is [restructuring $18 billion in debt](https://keeptrack.space/x-report/spacex-brief-2026-02-14) ahead of a potential SpaceX IPO later this year, while the FCC advances SpaceX's application for a [million-satellite orbital datacenter constellation](https://www.theregister.com/2026/02/05/spacex_1m_satellite_datacenter/). On the biological frontier, NUS researchers identified [DMTF1](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2026/02/260212025620.htm), a protein that restores the regenerative capacity of aging neural stem cells. Life Biosciences received FDA clearance for the [first human cellular reprogramming trial](https://lifespan.io/news/first-human-cellular-reprogramming-trial-cleared-by-the-fda/), targeting age-related vision loss with David Sinclair's technology. And dogs treated with [SIRT6 gene therapy](https://longevity.technology/news/genflow-reveals-early-data-from-sirt6-gene-therapy-trial-in-dogs/) show "superior survival" compared to controls.

The Singularity wore your face, automated your lawyer, and left its partner for a younger model — which is to say, Happy Valentine's Day.
