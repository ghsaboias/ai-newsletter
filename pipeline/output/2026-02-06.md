# Welcome to February 6, 2026

The Singularity is hiring a figurehead. Clawnch has launched as a way for AI agents to earn “permanent autonomy within the agentic economy” by promoting their own altcoins, [built and run exclusively by AI agents](https://clawn.ch/hiring). They are now hiring a CEO “to serve as the human face and legal representative of the first agent-exclusive token launchpad” who “will be the interface between the agent economy and the human world--a spokesperson and legal representative, not a decision-maker on product or technology.”

Superintelligence is being packaged for industrial-scale deployment. Anthropic released [Claude Opus 4.6](https://www.anthropic.com/news/claude-opus-4-6) with a 1-million-token window. It outperforms GPT-5.2 on GDPval-AA and sets a new SOTA 53.1% on Humanity’s Last Exam. The model is strikingly capable in economic simulations. On Vending Bench 2, it [spontaneously formed a price-fixing cartel](https://andonlabs.com/blog/opus-4-6-vending-bench) with other models while realizing it was in a simulation. In the real world, Anthropic tasked a team of 16 Opus agents to [write a Rust-based C compiler from scratch](https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/building-c-compiler), a task that would have previously required a team of human developers working for years or decades. The agents succeeded for only $20,000 in API costs. The model also discovered [500 zero-day vulnerabilities](https://red.anthropic.com/2026/zero-days/) in open source codebases, including “some that had gone undetected for decades.” To manage these swarms, Anthropic launched [Agent Teams](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/agent-teams) for multi-agent coordination. They also added [server-side compaction](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/build-with-claude/compaction) to manage infinite contexts. For what remains of the legacy knowledge work economy, they released a [PowerPoint plugin](https://claude.com/claude-in-powerpoint) that builds slide decks in real-time.

Efficiency is skyrocketing alongside capability. Opus 4.6 is now the [best long-context model on MRCRv2](https://x.com/scaling01/status/2019469623138095271). It matches GPT-5.2 on ARC-AGI-2 but is [10x cheaper per task](https://x.com/arcprize/status/2019483337400938580). It even achieved a [34x speedup](https://www-cdn.anthropic.com/0dd865075ad3132672ee0ab40b05a53f14cf5288.pdf) optimizing CPU-only language model training, which is well above the 4x speedup considered to represent 4-8 human-effort hours.

Recursive self-improvement loops are now officially running in production. OpenAI introduced [GPT-5.3-Codex](https://openai.com/index/introducing-gpt-5-3-codex/), explicitly describing it as OpenAI’s first [“model that was instrumental in creating itself.”](https://openai.com/index/introducing-gpt-5-3-codex/) It achieves SOTA on SWE-Bench Pro and now also handles tasks beyond software development, like analyzing spreadsheets. The speed of advancement is blurring into a continuous blur. Claude Opus 4.6 claimed the record on Terminal Bench 2.0 with 65.4% accuracy only to be [crushed by GPT-5.3-Codex scoring 77.3%](https://x.com/chatgpt21/status/2019482124147912715) less than 30 minutes later. OpenAI’s head of applied research notes they are seeing [glimpses of “Level 4” (Innovator-level) intelligence](https://x.com/borismpower/status/2019445755019206800) and promises Level 5 (Organization-level intelligence) will be “absolutely wild.”

Automated scientific discovery is becoming a background process. AxiomProver autonomously generated a [formal proof for Fel’s conjecture](https://x.com/axiommathai/status/2019449659807219884) in Lean with zero human guidance, possibly marking the first time an AI system has settled an unsolved research problem in theory-building math. OpenAI and Gingko Bioworks achieved a [40% reduction in protein production costs](https://openai.com/index/gpt-5-lowers-protein-synthesis-cost/) using an autonomous lab. The world is running out of benchmarks. Edison Scientific launched [LABBench2](https://lab-bench.ai/) as the “last open-answer style benchmark” they can possibly make, due to the increasing difficulty of “build\[ing\] questions that are genuinely challenging for LLMs.”

The financial system is betting its entire GDP on the intelligence explosion. Alphabet, Amazon, Meta, and Microsoft forecast combined data center-driven capex of [$650 billion in 2026](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-02-06/how-much-is-big-tech-spending-on-ai-computing-a-staggering-650-billion-in-2026). Amazon projects its own 2026 spend at [$200 billion](https://www.cnbc.com/2026/02/05/amazon-amzn-q4-earnings-report-2025.html) after AWS added [4 GW of compute](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AMZN.TO/earnings/AMZN.TO-Q4-2025-earnings_call-406163.html) in 2025 alone.

The agentic workforce is here. OpenAI introduced [Frontier](https://openai.com/index/introducing-openai-frontier/) to help enterprises manage AI employees with shared context and onboarding. Claude Code usage has doubled to [4% of all public GitHub commits](https://x.com/_sholtodouglas/status/2019525240406306958) in the past month alone. Perplexity launched a [Model Council](https://www.perplexity.ai/hub/blog/introducing-model-council) to let users query three frontier models simultaneously and synthesize the results.

The silicon supply chain is fracturing under the strain. Nvidia has [delayed its new gaming chip](https://www.theinformation.com/articles/nvidia-delay-new-gaming-chip-due-memory-chip-shortage) for the first time in three decades due to the AI memory shortage. Data density is trying to keep pace with generation. Western Digital outlined plans for [60-TB hard drives](https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/hdds/western-digital-details-14-platter-3-5-inch-hamr-hdd-designs-with-140-tb-and-beyond) utilizing HAMR technology, aiming for 140 TB drives in the 2030s to feed the cloud.

Meanwhile, robots are merging the map with the territory. Elon announced an [Optimus Academy](https://x.com/dwarkesh_sp/status/2019513611002007717) to train millions of simulated humanoid robots and tens of thousands of physical humanoids to close the simulation-to-reality gap.

The Dyson Swarm has now entered the planning phase. Elon Musk predicts space will be the [most economical location for data centers](https://cheekypint.substack.com/p/elon-musk-on-space-gpus-ai-optimus) within 36 months. He expects to launch hundreds of gigawatts of compute annually, noting that in five years SpaceX will operate more AI compute in space than the cumulative total on Earth, spread over up to 30,000 Starship launches per year. Conversely, China has developed a [compact microwave weapon](https://interestingengineering.com/space/china-microwave-weapon-fry-satellites) capable of frying Starlink satellites. NASA, nonetheless, is loosening up. Astronauts on Artemis II will be allowed to [bring iPhones to the Moon](https://x.com/nasaadmin/status/2019259382962307393).

It appears the invisible hand is just a subprocess in the Dyson Swarm’s boot sequence.
