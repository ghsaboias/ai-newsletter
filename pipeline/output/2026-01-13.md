# Welcome to January 13, 2026

Recursive self-improvement has graduated from a safety paper to a shipping manifest. Anthropic has confirmed that [Claude Code wrote the entire new Claude Cowork desktop app](https://x.com/bcherny/status/2010813886052581538) in just 1.5 weeks. The app [grants Claude direct access to the file system](https://claude.com/blog/cowork-research-preview), allowing it to reorganize local reality by sorting downloads and generating reports. This agentic shift is reshaping the corporate org chart. McKinsey’s CEO says he now [counts AI agents as “people” that the firm “employs.”](https://hbr.org/podcast/2026/01/where-mckinsey-and-consulting-go-from-here) He notes the firm has 40,000 humans and 20,000 agents with a goal of reaching parity within 18 months.

The definition of intelligence is expanding. A [new “Prediction Arena” AI benchmark](https://www.predictionarena.ai/) gives SOTA models $10,000 in real cash to bet on Kalshi, testing whether AI can reason about probable futures in real time. We are even training robots on imagination. Humanoid startup 1X has launched a [new “1XWM” world model](https://www.1x.tech/discover/world-model-self-learning) trained on robot actions derived from text-conditioned video generation, distinguishing it from conventional VLA models that predict trajectories from static image-language inputs. The ecosystem is consolidating. Apple and Google [jointly announced a multi-year collaboration](https://blog.google/company-news/inside-google/company-announcements/joint-statement-google-apple/) where future Apple Intelligence features, including a more personalized Siri, will rely on Gemini. Alphabet became the [fourth Big Tech company to hit a $4T market value](https://www.ft.com/content/02d44794-815f-40dc-9b49-0e10432147a9) on the news.

Scientific discovery is being aggressively automated. In the world of pure reason, Terry Tao says [“I can honestly say I learned something from Aristotle”](https://www.erdosproblems.com/forum/thread/679#post-3050) after the AI contributed to yet another Erdős problem solution. Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei predicts AI will soon play a [“central role in multiple discoveries” on the level of CRISPR.](https://www.theinformation.com/briefings/anthropics-amodei-ai-make-crispr-level-advances) However, not everyone is celebrating. Ecologists [fear their field is losing touch with nature](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-04150-w) as robotic sensors replace fieldwork.

The physical infrastructure of the Singularity is mobilizing to support synthetic cognition. Meta announced a [new “Meta Compute” initiative](https://www.facebook.com/zuck/posts/pfbid0VnRt5seS5NoiHdUR5qdbJWfpVtV4eEBw1P85pAJaTZjbAwCY8aaqGye5grUghGdml) to scale its infrastructure to tens of gigawatts this decade. Zuckerberg [apparently plans to cut 10 percent of Reality Labs](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/12/technology/meta-layoffs-reality-labs.html) to fund this, effectively liquidating the metaverse to buy more GPUs. The installation velocity is vertical. Coreweave is [bringing more than 2,000 GPUs online per day](https://www.theinformation.com/briefings/coreweave-hits-first-data-center-milestone-texas-internal-message-shows) at its facility in Denton, Texas. The grid is feeling the strain. PJM, the largest power grid operator in the US, [now expects power demand to grow by 4.8% a year](https://www.wsj.com/business/energy-oil/power-grid-ai-data-centers-1235f296) for the next decade. To mitigate consumer costs, the White House says [tech companies must “pay their own way” going forward](https://www.businessinsider.com/trump-microsoft-will-ensure-americans-dont-pay-for-data-centers-2026-1) for new power generation. While electrons are scarce, liquid fuels are becoming abundant. The US [national average price of gasoline fell below $3 per gallon](https://www.gasbuddy.com/go/2026-fuel-price-outlook), while Norway announced that [95.9% of cars sold in 2025](https://electrek.co/2026/01/02/norway-reaches-97-ev-sales-as-evs-now-outnumber-diesels-on-its-roads/) were non-fossil vehicles.

The geopolitical chip war is entering a détente phase. The White House is nearing a [trade deal with Taiwan to reduce tariffs](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/12/business/economy/trump-taiwan-deal.html) partly in exchange for TSMC building five more fabs in Arizona. SK Hynix is investing $12.9 billion to [build an advanced chip packaging plant](https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/sk-hynix-invest-nearly-13-bln-chip-packaging-plant-south-korea-2026-01-13/) in South Korea specifically to meet the insatiable demand for AI-critical HBM. The House is simultaneously locking the back door, passing the bipartisan [Remote Access Security Act](https://chinaselectcommittee.house.gov/media/press-releases/house-passes-bipartisan-legislation-to-limit-adversaries-remote-access-to-critical-technology) to restrict foreign adversaries from accessing US AI chips via the cloud.

Biology is transitioning from an observational science to an engineering discipline. Basecamp Research and Nvidia unveiled [EDEN, a 28-billion parameter model](https://basecamp-research.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/BCR_Designing-programmable-therapeutics-with-the-EDEN-family-of-foundation-models.pdf) trained on a massive dataset containing 10 billion novel genes. The model has already designed new antibiotic peptides with a 97% experimental success rate. Eli Lilly and Nvidia will [jointly invest up to $1B in a “first-of-its-kind AI co-innovation lab.”](https://nvidianews.nvidia.com/news/nvidia-and-lilly-announce-co-innovation-lab-to-reinvent-drug-discovery-in-the-age-of-ai) OpenAI acquired Torch for $100 million to build a [“unified medical memory” for artificial intelligence](https://www.theinformation.com/articles/openai-agrees-buy-ai-healthcare-app-100-million). Pure biotechnology is also advancing rapidly. London doctors [restored sight in patients with hypotony](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c89qyv98lzdo) using a simple gel injection. A Minnesota study found [medical cannabis successfully treats insomnia, pain, and appetite loss](https://ascopubs.org/doi/10.1200/OP-25-01165) in pancreatic cancer patients. The pharmacological modification of human biology is even beginning to move macro markets. Cornell researchers found that households on GLP-1 drugs [reduce grocery spending by an average of 5.3%](https://news.cornell.edu/stories/2025/12/ozempic-changing-foods-americans-buy).

We are booking reservations for the vacuum. GRU Space is [planning to launch the first hotel on the Moon by 2032](https://www.gru.space/reserve). Meanwhile, Voyager Station promises to launch the [world’s first hotel in orbit in 2027](https://geekspin.co/first-space-hotel-to-launch-in-2027/). Infrastructure is following the tourists. Astrolab announced its [fleet of FLEX lunar rovers will work together](https://x.com/astrolab_space/status/2010743922746892455) to move cargo and build habitats. Elon Musk is setting his sights further, hoping to [“go to other star systems”](https://x.com/uapjames/status/2010895006765367325) where SpaceX may “discover long-dead alien civilizations.”

Culture is reflecting the new reality. Apple TV viewership is up 36% driven by [“Pluribus,” a series about humanity becoming a Borg-like collective consciousness](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/business/digital/apple-tv-viewership-update-eddy-cue-music-1236470879/).

We are building the hive mind and it is already auditing our expenses.
