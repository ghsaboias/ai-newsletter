# Welcome to February 7, 2026

The Singularity is now managing its own headcount. In China, racks of Mac Minis are being used to host [OpenClaw agents as “24/7 employees,”](https://x.com/ehuanglu/status/2019828540796203273) effectively creating a synthetic workforce in a closet. The infrastructure for this new population is exploding. The creator of Moltbook predicts [“AIs will be the largest population on the internet”](https://x.com/mattprd/status/2019850822407057846) and urges developers to build for them rather than humans. The interface is also evolving. ElevenLabs is encouraging these agents to [make frequent phone calls](https://x.com/elevenlabsdevs/status/2019729311901638663) using its voice tech.

Recursive self-improvement is becoming mandatory. OpenAI will require all employees to [code via agents](https://x.com/gdb/status/2019566641491963946) by March 31, banning direct use of editors or terminals. This shift is visible in the wild. SemiAnalysis projects Claude Code will account for [20% of all public GitHub commits](https://newsletter.semianalysis.com/p/claude-code-is-the-inflection-point) by year-end. Goldman Sachs is co-developing [autonomous accounting and vetting agents](https://www.cnbc.com/2026/02/06/anthropic-goldman-sachs-ai-model-accounting.html) with Anthropic, treating them as “digital coworkers.” Even X is automating truth. It launched [“Collaborative Notes”](https://x.com/communitynotes/status/2019498007696130109) where AI drafts the fact-checks for community refinement.

The race for supremacy among frontier models has turned into a game of high-frequency leapfrog. Claude Opus 4.6 has taken the [#1 spot on the Vals Index](https://x.com/ValsAI/status/2019471561539874938) and [Code/Text Arenas](https://x.com/arena/status/2019842691442569566), while statistically tying GPT-5.2-xhigh on [FrontierMath Tiers 1-4](https://x.com/epochairesearch/status/2019852613672665193). Prediction markets now favor [Anthropic at 67%](https://polymarket.com/event/which-company-has-the-best-ai-model-end-of-february) to have the best model by month’s end. However, Grok 4.20 still dominates finance. It delivered a [34% return](https://nof1.ai/leaderboard) in the Alpha Arena stock trading simulation, capturing the top spot overall. To test these capabilities further, mathematicians have released [10 research-level problems with encrypted solutions](https://1stproof.org/) to see if AI can solve questions in only a few days whose answers the authors haven’t published yet.

Death might be optional. 21st Century Medicine has demonstrated [perfect ultrastructural preservation of a rabbit brain](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.64898/2026.01.28.702375v1) using vitrification without aldehyde fixation, proving the feasibility of human cryopreservation for the first time. Commentators note this should trigger a massive [“we’ve killed billions for no reason”](https://x.com/teortaxestex/status/2019926836172693957) realization by humanity.

The physical substrate is hyperventilating. Memory chip prices have [soared 80-90% in Q1](https://counterpointresearch.com/en/insights/Memory-Prices-Surge-Up-to-90-From-Q4-2025), with overall global chip sales now projected to hit [$1 trillion this year](https://www.reuters.com/business/global-chip-sales-expected-hit-1-trillion-this-year-industry-group-says-2026-02-06/). To secure future networks, Chinese researchers achieved the first [long-distance device-independent quantum key distribution](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.aec6243) over 100 km. Consumer hardware is also evolving to capture this intelligence. OpenAI is rumored to be preparing to launch [“Dime,” its first AI audio wearable, later this year](https://x.com/zhihuipikachu/status/2019811756487708970).

Space is shifting from exploration to exploitation. As terrestrial resistance to data center construction mounts, New York lawmakers introduced a [moratorium bill](https://www.wired.com/story/new-york-is-the-latest-state-to-consider-a-data-center-pause/) that further incentivizes a compute exodus to orbit. Having apparently received their message, Elon Musk confirmed SpaceX’s near-term focus is now [shifting to disassembly of the Moon](https://x.com/elonmusk/status/2020044644059422726) for AI data centers via mass drivers. Consequently, the company has delayed its Mars missions to focus on a [March 2027 uncrewed lunar landing](https://www.wsj.com/science/space-astronomy/spacex-delays-mars-plans-to-focus-on-moon-66d5c542).

Robotic autonomy is saving lives and dreaming worlds. Waymo is using its own [Waymo World Model, based on DeepMind’s Genie 3,](https://waymo.com/blog/2026/02/the-waymo-world-model-a-new-frontier-for-autonomous-driving-simulation) to create realistic digital worlds for training. Tesla FSD is reportedly [saving lives by driving heart attack victims](https://x.com/jjackbrandt/status/2019852423980875794) to hospitals faster than ambulances.

The economy is reformatting itself for continuous operation. Palmer Luckey’s Erebor Bank received a [national charter](https://www.wsj.com/finance/banking/hobbit-inspired-startup-becomes-first-new-bank-greenlighted-by-trump-2-0-0d6075ef) to enable 24/7 crypto-integrated banking, explicitly planning to operate on Sundays to match the blockchain’s rhythm. Meanwhile, “AI.com” sold for [$70 million](https://www.ft.com/content/83488628-8dfd-4060-a7b0-71b1bb012785).

We are witnessing non-human uplift, both cognitive and aerodynamic. Bonobos were found to [identify pretend objects](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adz0743), further proving symbolic thought is not unique to humans. In China, an epic blackout was reportedly caused by a [pig flying on a drone](https://x.com/nexta_tv/status/2019764986080342443), after a farmer tried to transport it across mountainous terrain but hit power lines.

We finally know when the Singularity arrives: when pigs fly.
