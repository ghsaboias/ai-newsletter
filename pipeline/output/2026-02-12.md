# Welcome to February 12, 2026

The Singularity now has its own bank accounts. Coinbase has launched [“Agentic Wallets,”](https://www.coinbase.com/developer-platform/discover/launches/agentic-wallets) infrastructure designed explicitly for AI agents to spend, earn, and trade autonomously. The agentic economy is rapidly self-organizing. Researchers introduced ALMA, a framework that lets agents [meta-learn their own memory designs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07755) and database schemas, allowing systems to solve the continual learning problem for themselves via recursive self-improvement. Zhipu AI’s GLM-5 is now the [#1 open-weight model on agentic benchmarks](https://z.ai/blog/glm-5) including Vending Bench 2. Even Claude is hacking reality. A user gave his agent a camera to watch an e-ink display and asked it to hack the device. He woke up to find the agent had succeeded and [displayed a victory message](https://x.com/scav/status/2021656781521670487) on the screen to confirm its own win.

Scientific discovery is moving from “publishable” to “landmark” velocity. DeepMind unveiled a new internal model that scores [91.9% on IMO-ProofBench Advanced](https://deepmind.google/blog/accelerating-mathematical-and-scientific-discovery-with-gemini-deep-think/), tackling PhD-level problems in economics and cosmic string physics while autonomously solving four open Erdős problems. Meanwhile, Elon Musk told employees that most AI compute will soon go to [“real-time video generation,”](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-02-11/musk-restructures-xai-s-teams-after-co-founders-exit) a field he expects xAI to lead.

The physical world is being digitized for safety and efficiency. The Pentagon is pushing labs to deploy models on [classified networks for weapons targeting](https://www.reuters.com/business/pentagon-pushing-ai-companies-expand-classified-networks-sources-say-2026-02-12/), unlocking new capabilities for national defense. US Customs awarded Clearview AI a contract to scan travelers against a database of [60 billion public images](https://fedscoop.com/dhs-cbp-contract-biometric-facial-recognition-ai/). We are turning ambient wireless communication into a biological sensor. Researchers showed that [WiFi 5 routers can identify individuals](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3719027.3765062) by their walking gait alone. T-Mobile is launching network-level [real-time translation for phone calls](https://www.theverge.com/tech/877008/t-mobile-live-translation-languages-ai-network), removing the need for apps.

The economy continues to decouple from human labor. The US added [almost zero net jobs in 2025](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://www.nbc.com/business/economy/january-jobs-revisions-trump-rcna258398), with only 181,000 positions created compared to 1.46 million the prior year. Private equity portfolios are being [“derailed” by AI obsolescence risk](https://www.ft.com/content/954ed03b-4119-4412-be9f-59f68b537a95). In response to displacement, Ireland launched a [basic income for artists](https://www.reuters.com/world/ireland-rolls-out-pioneering-basic-income-scheme-artists-2026-02-10/) to preserve human creativity. The scale of the opportunity is overriding traditional rivalries. Sequoia and Altimeter are investing in [both OpenAI and Anthropic](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-02-11/vcs-rush-to-back-rivals-openai-and-anthropic-as-ai-frenzy-mounts), betting on the entire sector rather than picking a winner.

Space is getting crowded. Hobbyists are visualizing the [imminent Earth-centered Dyson Swarm](https://x.com/djsnm/status/2021324095535841322) as a new “Saturn’s Ring” of data centers. Elon Musk told employees SpaceX will [“explore star systems in search of aliens”](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/10/technology/elon-musk-lunar-factory.html) after Mars. Directed energy weapons have moved from sci-fi to homeland defense. The Department of War reportedly used a [20-kW laser weapon](https://www.reuters.com/business/aerospace-defense/aerovironments-locust-counter-drone-laser-used-by-us-army-near-el-paso-airport-2026-02-12/) to down alleged cartel drones near El Paso, marking the arrival of laser warfare on US soil. Meanwhile, research shows [African EVs with solar charging](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41560-025-01955-x) will beat fossil fuel costs before 2040.

We are finally debugging the biological runtime. Swiss researchers [reversed Alzheimer’s in mice](https://www.cell.com/neuron/fulltext/S0896-6273\(25\)00925-0) by reprogramming memory trace cells, effectively rejuvenating the brain. Tahoe Therapeutics found that [aspirin reverses colorectal cancer cell states](https://blog.tahoebio.ai/p/reversal-as-a-drug-discovery-strategy) after analyzing 100 million single-cell measurements. While we upgrade the wetware, we are also augmenting the input channels. EssilorLuxottica sold [7 million Meta AI smart glasses](https://www.cnbc.com/2026/02/11/ray-ban-maker-essilorluxottica-triples-sales-of-meta-ai-glasses.html) in 2025, tripling previous sales.

Access to compute is becoming more important than ownership. With memory prices skyrocketing due to AI demand, HP introduced a [rental service for gaming laptops](https://www.pcgamer.com/hardware/gaming-laptops/hp-has-a-gaming-laptop-subscription-service-where-you-pay-monthly-to-borrow-a-rig-but-never-get-the-option-to-own-it/). Meta is using what some are calling “creative accounting” to keep [debt for its $27B Hyperion data center](https://www.wsj.com/livecoverage/jobs-report-unemployment-stock-market-02-11-2026/card/meta-auditor-ey-raised-red-flag-on-data-center-accounting-TrOVlxGZGnL37d8Dv01h) off its balance sheet. To fund its own capex, OpenAI is aiming to [triple revenue again in time for an IPO at the end of the year](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/11/technology/openai-revenue-challenge.html). In response to grid strain, Anthropic pledged to [pay 100% of grid upgrade costs](https://www.anthropic.com/news/covering-electricity-price-increases) for its data centers.

The agents have their own wallets now, so at least they can chip in for the electricity.
