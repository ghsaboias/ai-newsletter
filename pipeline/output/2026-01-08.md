# Welcome to January 8, 2026

The marginal cost of intelligence is trending toward zero. NanoGPT Speedrun training times have collapsed yet again to a new world record of [109.2 seconds](https://x.com/classiclarryd/status/2008963501688324228) thanks to a novel attention mechanism that enables queries to retrieve two values per target position instead of one. This collapse in the cost of intelligence is beginning to infect the physical sciences. Math, Inc. has partnered with Terry Tao to [autoformalize an entire web of estimates in analytic number theory](https://x.com/mathematics_inc/status/2008961838856171617), while a Brookhaven physicist used OpenAI’s o3-mini-high model to [exactly solve the q=3 case of the 1-D J1-J2 q-state Potts model](https://www.bnl.gov/newsroom/news.php?a=122742), signaling that AI has begun closing open problems in physics.

The economics of orbit are being rewritten. Mach33 analysis finds that manufacturing 10,000 Starships per year renders orbital compute cheaper than terrestrial data center builds ($300M transport versus $14B land acquisition), turns massive orbital construction into a simple logistics problem, and drops [point-to-point earth transport to $1,000/ticket](https://research.33fg.com/analysis/a-world-with-10-000-starships), rivaling business class. ARK Invest concurs, predicting [SpaceX will cross the orbital computing cost-efficiency threshold by 2030](https://x.com/wintonark/status/2008704744723017891), requiring 100 launches a day. As a prelude to the Dyson Swarm, orbit is becoming a political command center. Reza Pahlavi is actively coordinating an attempted [regime change in Iran from low Earth orbit](https://x.com/pahlavireza/status/2009041925647548815) via hundreds of thousands of Starlink terminals.

AI is becoming the default interface for biological maintenance. Cellular Intelligence is building the first [Universal Virtual Cell-Signaling Model](https://www.cellularintelligence.com/science) to simulate combinatorial perturbations, while Polyphron has successfully analyzed [700 tissue constructs](https://www.polyphron.com/post/a-compute-first-paradigm-for-an-autonomous-tissue-foundry) in its autonomous foundry. We are even externalizing gestation. San Francisco startup “Becoming” has grown a [mouse embryo in a lab-grown placenta](https://www.corememory.com/p/a-new-way-to-study-life-becoming) outside the body. Adoption is systemic. 27% of US hospitals are now paying for [commercial AI licenses](https://www.wsj.com/tech/ai/hospitals-are-a-proving-ground-for-what-ai-can-do-and-what-it-cant-60e4020c), and OpenAI has launched ChatGPT Health, a dedicated experience that [connects directly to electronic medical records](https://openai.com/index/introducing-chatgpt-health/).

Robotics is ploughing through any remaining data walls in its path. Elon Musk estimates only [10 billion miles of training data](https://x.com/elonmusk/status/2009161554785128729) are needed for unsupervised self-driving to conquer the “long tail of complexity.” To generate data, Chinese local governments have funded 40 centers where [human “cyber-laborers” mimic robots folding clothes](https://restofworld.org/2026/china-robots-training-centers-workers/) to collect ground-truth training sets. Meanwhile, the hardware is ready. The Tensor Robocar debuted with [8,000 TOPS of compute](https://interestingengineering.com/ces-2026/tensor-robocar-ai-first-level-4-autonomous-vehicle) (8x Nvidia Thor chips), and Ford plans [eyes-off driving in 2028](https://www.cnbc.com/2026/01/07/ford-eyes-off-driving-ev-2028.html). Arm Holdings has reorganized to form a [Physical AI unit](https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/arm-launches-physical-ai-division-expand-robotics-market-2026-01-07/) to capture the corresponding silicon market.

The labor arbitrage shows signs of nearing completion. Subsidized Sonnet 4.5 usage now costs only [~$10/hour for some use cases,](https://x.com/pvncher/status/2008531082271224283) effectively reaching parity with the US minimum wage. The automation of creativity is also visible. “Clopus” (Claude Code on Opus 4.5) created a [30-second Hermès ad from scratch](https://x.com/deedydas/status/2008747553261842483), scripting, directing, and editing video and voice autonomously.

The legacy world is mutating to survive the transition. Venezuela’s stock market has [surged 100%](https://cryptobriefing.com/venezuela-stock-market-surges-post-maduro-optimism/) post-Maduro, fueled by optimism in oil and infrastructure, while televisions are evolving into [matte-screen art frames](https://www.wired.com/story/art-frame-tv-trends/) to blend into smaller living spaces.

Meanwhile, the financial system is pricing in the Singularity. Alphabet has surpassed Apple in market cap [($3.89T vs $3.85T)](https://www.barrons.com/articles/alphabet-stock-apple-market-cap-625151cc), taking the #2 spot behind Nvidia, while Anthropic is raising another $10 billion at a [$350 billion valuation](https://www.wsj.com/tech/ai/anthropic-raising-10-billion-at-350-billion-value-62af49f4), nearly doubling in four months. Samsung’s profit has [tripled to a record high](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-01-07/samsung-posts-record-profit-after-ai-supercharges-memory-market) on AI memory demand, and Zhipu has become the [first pure-play LLM company to IPO](https://www.asiabusinessoutlook.com/news/zhipu-ipo-marks-china-s-first-major-generative-ai-stock-listing-nwid-11027.html). Even the risks signal velocity. A U of Chicago economist warns that shifting income from high-spending workers to low-spending capital owners could trigger a [Keynesian demand collapse](https://aleximas.substack.com/p/will-advanced-ai-lead-to-negative), but this may just be the friction of transition. Opting for sunshine over stagnation, Google founder Larry Page has [fled California for Miami](https://www.wsj.com/real-estate/luxury-homes/google-co-founder-larry-page-spends-173-4-million-on-two-miami-homes-3553e880) to escape a proposed billionaire wealth tax.

Atlas isn’t shrugging, he’s just watching the intelligence explosion from the beach.
