# Welcome to December 13, 2025

The clock speed of autonomy is accelerating. Epoch AI extrapolates that Gemini 3 Pro has achieved a [SOTA autonomous time horizon of 4.9 hours](https://x.com/EpochAIResearch/status/1999585226989928650), with GPT-5.2 following at 3.5 hours. Based on this trajectory, some analysts now estimate the doubling time for autonomous capability is [down to just one month](https://x.com/daniel_mac8/status/1999590063106052595), a pace that renders annual roadmaps obsolete. To keep up, Zoom has deployed [“Federated AI,”](https://www.zoom.com/en/blog/humanitys-last-exam-zoom-ai-breakthrough/) a swarm of small, open, and closed models that scored 48.1% on Humanity’s Last Exam, beating even the monolithic Gemini 3 Pro. The network is officially smarter than the node. Meanwhile, Google has updated [Gemini 2.5 Flash with native audio](https://blog.google/products/gemini/gemini-audio-model-updates/), allowing agents to navigate complex voice workflows with human-like nuance.

Science is being containerized. The National Science Foundation has launched [“Tech Labs,”](https://www.nsf.gov/news/nsf-announces-new-initiative-launch-scale-new-generation) a new class of independent research organizations designed to break technical bottlenecks that universities can’t touch. The DOE is backing this industrial approach with [$320 million to build the “American Science and Security Platform,”](https://www.energy.gov/articles/energy-department-advances-investments-ai-science) an integrated discovery engine comprising an “American Science Cloud” and a “Transformational AI Models Consortium” explicitly designed to double the nation’s scientific productivity within a decade. The industrialization of scientific discovery with AI is already bearing fruit: Terry Tao confirms his collaborators and he have now solved [Erdős problem #1026](https://terrytao.wordpress.com/2025/12/08/the-story-of-erdos-problem-126/) using a hybrid of AlphaEvolve and deep literature search, turning the “lone genius” into a “human-in-the-loop.”

A silicon curtain is falling. The U.S. has launched a [“Pax Silica Initiative”](https://www.state.gov/releases/office-of-the-spokesperson/2025/12/pax-silica-initiative/) to secure the entire semiconductor stack, from minerals to logic, with allies like Japan and the UAE. China is countering with a [$70 billion subsidy package](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-12-12/china-prepares-as-much-as-70-billion-in-chip-sector-incentives) to decouple its chip industry from the West.

Robotics is getting a world model. DeepMind demonstrates that [Veo can now be used to evaluate robotic policies](https://veo-robotics.github.io/), effectively allowing robots to “dream” scenarios before executing them. In the physical world, Unitree has launched the [first humanoid app store](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AEhnXtBEC_E), commoditizing physical skills, while Tesla’s holiday update lets users [ask Grok to handle FSD navigation](https://x.com/niccruzpatane/status/1999742756730925184).

Protein design has graduated from biology to nanotechnology. Researchers are using AI to create proteins that [retain their structure above 150°C](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41557-025-01998-3) and withstand extreme physical forces, effectively inventing hardware-grade biochemistry that functions outside the narrow constraints of life.

The Singularity is backwards compatible. Hungarian researchers have enabled rats to [play DOOM in VR](https://ratsplaydoom.com/) using a complete motion-tracking setup. This is a primitive form of uplift: plugging a biological neural net directly into a digital game loop to expand its cognitive horizon.

The invisible hand is getting a firmware update. OpenAI’s Sam Altman confirms that [enterprise sales are the priority for 2026](https://www.bigtechnology.com/p/enterprise-will-be-a-top-openai-priority), while Mira Murati’s Thinking Machines releases [Tinker](https://thinkingmachines.ai/blog/tinker-general-availability/) to democratize fine-tuning. Even the payout mechanism is changing: YouTube now allows creators to cash out in [stablecoins](https://fortune.com/2025/12/11/youtube-paypal-google-stablecoin-payouts-pyusd/).

Education is being patched to match the new industrial reality. xAI has partnered with El Salvador to bring [Grok-powered tutoring to every public school student](https://x.ai/news/el-salvador-partnership), while UATX is building an [Applied Engineering Lab](https://x.com/serobinsonjr/status/1999601771887370274) next door to SpaceX to pipeline talent directly into the hard-tech industrial base.

The energy grid is prepping for ignition. Commonwealth Fusion Systems’ commercial demo site near Boston is [75% complete](https://www.axios.com/newsletters/axios-future-of-energy-f2cdfd00-d5dd-11f0-9a68-29513e1011db.html), signaling that net-energy fusion is moving from physics to construction.

Space is becoming a server rack. SpaceX is on track to have [10,000 Starlink satellites in orbit by February](https://x.com/sawyermerritt/status/1999565838802723174). Even Mars is getting wired: Blue Origin plans to deploy an [AI data center to the Red Planet in 2028](https://www.blueorigin.com/mars-telecommunications-orbiter).

The Solar System finally has a business model.
