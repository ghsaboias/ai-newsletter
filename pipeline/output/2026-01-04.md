# Welcome to January 4, 2026

We have officially entered the recursive self-improvement phase. Elon Musk now recognizes that [we have entered the Singularity](https://x.com/elonmusk/status/2007738847397036143), a sentiment backed by the collapse of human programming. The volume of new questions on StackOverflow has [decayed to pre-public levels](https://data.stackexchange.com/stackoverflow/query/1926661), signaling the end of the human developer era. In place of humans asking humans for programming help, new paradigms like Recursive Language Models (RLMs) are emerging, [programmatically decomposing and recursively calling themselves](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24601v1) to handle contexts two orders of magnitude larger than their windows. To monetize the intelligence explosion, xAI has launched [Grok Business and Enterprise tiers](https://x.ai/news/grok-business), operationalizing the Singularity for $30 a seat.

Scientific discovery is being compressed into minutes. Claude Code is collapsing the research cycle, [replicating a 3-month PhD project in 20 minutes](https://x.com/jkeatn/status/2007527581650764112) and generating [Google’s entire year of agent orchestrator work in one hour](https://x.com/rakyll/status/2007239758158975130). This acceleration extends to biology. The CEO of MagicPath used Claude Code to [scan his raw DNA for health risks](https://x.com/skirano/status/2007540021536993712), turning genomics into a debugging task. Simultaneously, Danielle Fong demonstrated that Claude Code can use Nano Banana as a [persistent visual memory](https://x.com/daniellefong/status/2007342908878533028), while Gemini 3 Pro is achieving [60% accuracy on 2-hop latent reasoning](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/aYtrLhoZtCKZnfBvA/recent-llms-can-do-2-hop-and-3-hop-latent-no-cot-reasoning), effectively “thinking” across degrees of separation without chain-of-thought. However, the model semantics remain fragile: Italian researchers found that [curated adversarial poetry](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15304) acts as a universal jailbreak, bypassing safety mechanisms simply by being too literary to censor.

The physical infrastructure of intelligence is becoming geologically significant and increasingly chaotic. Even the machine learning algorithms running in Microsoft’s new training clusters are now [visible from orbit](https://x.com/semianalysis_/status/2007633079041724443), manifesting as distinct building architectures for GPU-based coherent training versus CPU-based RL environments. Meanwhile, Meta is resorting to a bricolage of [four different turbine types](https://x.com/semianalysis_/status/2007451888707338307) just to power its 200-MW Ohio cluster. Thermodynamics is still fighting back. OpenAI’s Stargate in the UAE has been [heat-derated from 1.3 GW to 1 GW](https://x.com/semianalysis_/status/2007572682598949238) due to desert temperatures.

To escape these terrestrial limits, the race is headed off-world. Former SpaceX engineers argue that [space-based data centers are about to become faster to deploy than ground builds](https://x.com/quincyedmundlee/status/2007520638504972765), with 1,000 Starship launches capable of deploying 1 GW of orbit compute in 0.1 years, versus 2 years for Stargate Abilene. Musk confirmed [Starship 4 will be 10-20% longer](https://x.com/elonmusk/status/2007604457828163911) to haul this mass. At the same time, Aerojet Rocketdyne is proposing [nuclear-electric propulsion](https://aerospaceamerica.aiaa.org/year-in-review/new-nuclear-propulsion-concepts-could-enable-solar-system-exploration-and-resource-utilization/) for deep-space logistics, using a vehicle that resembles the elongated _Discovery_ from “2001: A Space Odyssey.”

Warfare has become a high-frequency trading environment. The capture of Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro was orchestrated by [CIA stealth drones](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/03/world/americas/cia-venezuela-maduro.html) and [cyberattacks that cut the capital’s power](https://www.politico.com/news/2026/01/03/trump-venezuela-cyber-operation-maduro-00709816). But, in a cyberpunk twist, an anonymous coder claims to have [vibe-coded a bot to track Pentagon pizza orders](https://x.com/sweetcheeksreal/status/2007406093316559287), predicting the strike and netting $80,000, while another trader turned [$30,000 into $436,000](https://www.axios.com/2026/01/03/maduro-capture-bets-trade-prediction-markets) on the news. The fog of war is being cleared by arbitrage.

Biology is being hot-swapped. Silicon Valley is increasingly running on a [grey market of Chinese peptides](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/03/business/chinese-peptides-silicon-valley.html), injecting what some call “Ozempic for autism” (oxytocin). On the institutional side, Alibaba’s AI is [detecting pancreatic cancer in non-contrast CTs](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/02/world/asia/china-ai-cancer-pancreatic.html), and ByteDance’s [SeedFold protein folding models have taken #1 on FoldBench](https://seedfold.github.io/). We are even redefining the nature of antibiotic resistance. Israeli researchers have discovered [two distinct archetypes of bacterial persistence](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.adt6577), splitting the enemy into regulated and dysregulated factions.

Human-machine boundaries are dissolving. Boston Dynamics’ Atlas humanoids have begun [working inside Hyundai’s sprawling Georgia auto plant](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MwYW8M01BmM). Tesla Cybercabs are now [roaming Austin](https://www.teslarati.com/tesla-cybercab-changing-the-look-austin-roads-not-in-production-yet/) while other Tesla vehicles are powering up at the [world’s largest Supercharging oasis in Lost Hills](https://evchargingstations.com/chargingnews/teslas-largest-supercharging-oasis-now-fully-open/), which combines 164 stalls with a solar microgrid.

Governments are scrambling to adapt. The UN’s International Seabed Authority is finalizing rules for [deep-sea mining](https://www.science.org/content/article/deep-sea-mining-race-ramps-mission-will-assess-whether-ecosystems-recover-afterward), issuing 31 contracts to harvest polymetallic nodules, cobalt-rich crusts, and sulfides from hydrothermal vents. California has launched [DROP](https://consumer.drop.privacy.ca.gov/) to let citizens vanish from data brokers, while Japan is [quadrupling its AI chip budget to ¥1.23 trillion](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-12-26/japan-to-quadruple-spending-support-for-chips-ai-in-budget) and Alaska is deploying [AI judges to navigate probate court](https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/alaskas-court-system-built-ai-chatbot-didnt-go-smoothly-rcna235985).

It turns out that you can just (ask superintelligence to) do things.
