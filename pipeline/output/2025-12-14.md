# Welcome to December 14, 2025

The AI infrastructure buildout is becoming geological. China has activated a [nationwide optical backbone](https://interestingengineering.com/ai-robotics/china-distributed-ai-supercomputer-network) that fuses scattered data centers into a unified AI supercomputer, effectively treating the entire country’s compute as a single node. In the US, private data center construction has hit an [annualized rate of $41 billion](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-12-12/ai-data-center-boom-may-suck-resources-away-from-road-bridge-work), sucking up so much labor and material that it is actively displacing municipal infrastructure projects. Europe is buying its way back into the hardware game, approving [€623 million in aid](https://www.reuters.com/business/eu-approves-german-state-aid-support-chip-factories-2025-12-11/) for two new first-of-a-kind semiconductor fabs in Germany.

The last unautomated barrier is context. Google Translate has rolled out a [beta of Gemini live speech-to-speech](https://x.com/GoogleAI/status/1999560839679082507), a model that doesn’t just translate words but captures the “nuance of human speech.” Meanwhile, Amazon is adding an AI layer to the Kindle that lets you [interrogate books directly](https://www.pcmag.com/news/kindles-new-ai-feature-can-answer-questions-about-your-books-whether-authors), filling in plot holes or character details without ever leaving the page. The text is no longer static; it is a queryable database.

We are writing code for matter. MIT researchers have demonstrated a “speech-to-reality” system that lets users [command a robotic arm to build furniture](https://news.mit.edu/2025/mit-researchers-speak-objects-existence-using-ai-robotics-1205) in five minutes. This isn’t manufacturing; it’s compilation. Simultaneously, DARPA has launched the [“Generative Optogenetics” program](https://www.darpa.mil/research/programs/go), aiming to build a “nucleic acid compiler” that uses light to write DNA and RNA directly inside living cells.

The energy grid is being patched by intelligence. Atomic Canyon is using the Frontier supercomputer to train [nuclear-specific AI models](https://www.olcf.ornl.gov/2025/12/11/frontier-supercomputer-ushers-in-new-era-of-nuclear-ai/) that speed up document analysis, aiming to keep California’s Diablo Canyon power plant operational until 2030 to feed the AI load.

Regulatory epistemology is shifting from statistics to mechanics. The FDA is proposing a [“plausible mechanism” pathway](https://www.raps.org/news-and-articles/news-articles/2025/11/fda-leaders-propose-new-%E2%80%98plausible-mechanism-pathw) to approve personalized medicines without randomized trials, effectively acknowledging that n=1 is the future of medicine.

The Singularity is now a distinct economic era. Cisco stock has finally [surpassed its Dotcom bubble peak](https://www.ft.com/content/b27ae706-6244-4337-81cd-5204bd2b9a00) after 26 years, a lagging indicator that the physical internet has finally caught up to the hype of 2000. Meanwhile, Netflix is [opening theme parks in repurposed department stores](https://www.modernretail.co/operations/netflix-transforms-former-mall-department-stores-into-experiential-venues/), filling the retail void with synthetic experiences. And if you needed proof the startup ecosystem is accelerating: research confirms the release of ChatGPT caused a [6% jump in new business formation](https://www.arxiv.org/abs/2512.06506).

We are decoupling longevity from the evolutionary algorithm. Elon Musk predicts aging will be [stopped and reversed via synthetic mRNA](https://x.com/Vision4theBlind/status/1999652606667555024), while a new study suggests that [suppressing the reproductive drive extends lifespan](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-09836-9) across all mammalian species. We are hacking the trade-offs of biology.

We are building the emulator for the dead. The TimeCapsuleLLM project is training models exclusively on [1800-1875 London texts](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1pkpsee/training_an_llm_only_on_1800s_london_texts_90gb/) to resurrect the worldview of the Victorians, a first step toward the Cosmist dream shared by Tsiolkovsky: using technology to conquer not just space, but time.

The killer app of the Singularity is resurrecting every human who ever lived.
