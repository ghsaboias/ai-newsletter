# Welcome to December 26, 2025

The yardstick has snapped. The ARC Prize Foundation has [declared the saturation of the ARC-AGI-1 and ARC-AGI-2 benchmarks](https://x.com/fchollet/status/2004276612385108221), admitting that current tests can no longer bound the fluid intelligence of the frontier. The goalposts have been moved to “Millennium Problem” complexity, effectively conceding that the next benchmark for AI is not human exams, but the unsolved limits of mathematics itself. This cognitive escape velocity is matched by physical recursion. In Beijing, Linkerbot humanoids are [assembling and testing their own hands](https://x.com/Robo_Tuo/status/2003475372856475902), creating a closed loop of robotic self-replication that previews the coming von Neumann machines. The cycle is tightening everywhere: the NanoGPT training speedrun has [smashed the two-minute barrier at 119.3 seconds](https://x.com/classiclarryd/status/2004248941878296580), reducing model genesis to a rounding error.

The labor market is processing the obsolescence of code. US programmer employment has [dropped 27.5% in two years](https://spectrum.ieee.org/ai-effect-entry-level-jobs), a brutal confirmation that software development as we know it may no longer be a long-term human career. But it’s not just programming. DeepMind co-founder Shane Legg predicts [all remote work will vanish within a decade](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3u_FAv33G0), displaced by agents. The vacuum is being filled by capital. The AI sector [minted 50 new billionaires this year](https://www.forbes.com/sites/aliciapark/2025/12/25/ai-minted-more-than-50-new-billionaires-in-2025/) as it captured 50% of all global venture funding. Venture capital is mutating into infrastructure finance; ex-a16z partner Anjney Midha is raising [$10 billion to build a single gigawatt of AI capacity](https://www.theinformation.com/briefings/vc-partner-midha-talks-establish-1-gigawatt-data-center-venture). Meanwhile, crypto has institutionalized; [M&A deals hit $8.6 billion](https://www.ft.com/content/b4d5e238-c34a-4602-91d0-4c7300b0006f) as the sector consolidates into the establishment.

The architecture of thought is being refined. Jürgen Schmidhuber has unveiled [PoPE (Polar Coordinate Positional Embedding)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10534), a geometric fix to the Transformer that boosts performance on everything from genomics to symbolic music. DeepMind is targeting a time skip, focusing on scientific problems where [AI can fast-forward progress by a decade](https://www.wired.com/story/alphafold-changed-science-after-5-years-its-still-evolving/).

The intelligence deployment gap is closing. OpenAI has declared a [“capability overhang”](https://x.com/openai/status/2003594025098785145) between model potential and actual usage by consumers, apparently interpreting this lag as a signal to push reasoning models more aggressively into healthcare, business, and daily life in 2026. At the same time, the user base is shifting. [Gemini now reportedly claims 20% of traffic](https://x.com/similarweb/status/2004113864347029663), while [Grok has taken the lead in time-spent metrics](https://x.com/similarweb/status/2004167745475084712).

The silicon food chain has inverted. Nvidia is projected to displace Apple as [TSMC’s largest customer in 2026](https://x.com/rohanpaul_ai/status/2001293647543935322), accounting for 20% of revenue. The market is already rewarding the new king. Nvidia’s $20 billion Groq acquisition [paid for itself overnight](https://x.com/kobeissiletter/status/2004396381407223811) as Nvidia’s market cap jumped more than $30 billion. Bank of America forecasts the chip sector will [breach $1 trillion in sales next year](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/these-6-stocks-will-lead-the-1-trillion-chip-surge-in-2026-bofa-says-130008431.html). But the bottleneck remains memory. US hyperscalers have started [firing executives who fail to secure High Bandwidth Memory](https://www.sedaily.com/NewsView/2H1V9N0FYA), stationing replacements in South Korea to plead for supply.

Energy is finding new vectors. China’s latest maglev test reached a record [700 km/h in two seconds](https://www.newsbytesapp.com/news/science/china-s-high-speed-maglev-reaches-700-km-h-in-2-seconds/story) on a 400-meter track, demonstrating acceleration capabilities that hint at electromagnetic launch systems for aerospace. Offshore, Samsung Heavy Industries won U.S. approval for a [floating nuclear power platform](https://www.neimagazine.com/news/samsung-wins-approval-for-floating-smr/) equipped with modular reactors, designed to power desalination or remote data centers for 60 years. The grid is greening by force. China is enforcing the [world’s first mandatory EV energy efficiency standard](https://technode.com/2025/12/26/china-to-enforce-new-ev-energy-consumption-standard-in-2026-capping-2-ton-models-at-15-1-kwh-100-km/) starting in 2026, while [nine European nations have passed 25% EV adoption](https://x.com/piloly/status/2003481426662981756).

Safety is becoming superhuman. Elon Musk predicts [Tesla FSD will be 100x safer than humans](https://x.com/elonmusk/status/2003898783063756801) in five years, while Garmin’s Autoland successfully [landed a plane near Denver in an emergency](https://www.cnn.com/2025/12/23/us/airplane-lands-itself-first-aviation-automation) with passengers on board, a world first for autonomous aviation in a crisis. Yet human labor persists, for now, on the margins. Waymo is paying gig workers to [manually close robotaxi doors](https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2025/12/25/waymo-robots-human-work/).

We are gaining full write access to biology. Columbia researchers demonstrated the first programmable [in-vivo DNA methylation editing](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-67222-5), allowing precise epigenetic control. The geography of discovery is also shifting; Goldman Sachs reports that [China now originates 25% of innovative drug candidates](https://www.goldmansachs.com/insights/articles/china-is-increasing-its-share-of-global-drug-development), driving nearly half of global licensing deals.

Capital has decided to terraform the Solar System. SpaceX is now valued at [$800 billion](https://x.com/JarsyInc/status/2004218619933479010), worth more than the top six US defense firms combined, and Elon is promising [100-ton payloads to orbit in 2026](https://spacenews.com/musk-confident-starship-will-start-launching-100-tons-to-orbit-next-year/).

Meanwhile, for the last year, a German court has prevented [robots from working in supermarkets on Sundays](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-13278447/german-court-rules-sundays-robots-teo-tegut.html), citing a 1,700-year-old decree by Emperor Constantine.

The Singularity, however, does not take days off.
