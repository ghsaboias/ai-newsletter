# Welcome to January 7, 2026

The “AI Dream” has been realized years ahead of schedule. Engineers are now concluding that Opus 4.5 in Claude Code [“is AGI,”](https://x.com/tyler_m_john/status/2008487701775863934) a sentiment echoed by the collapse of unsolved mathematics. Mathematician Bartosz Naskrecki reports that GPT-5.2 Pro has become so proficient that he [“can hardly find any non-trivial hard problem”](https://x.com/nasqret/status/2008672809094905970) it cannot solve in two hours, declaring “the Singularity is near.” This is not hyperbole. GPT-5.2 and Harmonic’s Aristotle have [autonomously resolved Erdos problem #728](https://x.com/acerfur/status/2008608669047644398) before any human, marking the moment where mathematical discovery becomes an automated background process.

Prediction is becoming a verifiable compute primitive. The new OpenForecaster 8B model is making [SOTA predictions on open-ended questions](https://openforecaster.github.io/), competitive with proprietary giants by treating post-training events as the “future” it must predict. Strategic thinking is being debugged in public. Vercel is hosting [live chess matches between frontier models](https://v0-chess-match.vercel.app/), bringing reinforcement learning full circle. Meanwhile, xAI has confirmed Grok 5 is [currently in training](https://x.ai/news/series-e).

Capital is flooding the engine room. xAI has raised a massive [$20 billion round](https://www.cnbc.com/2026/01/06/elon-musk-xai-raises-20-billion-from-nvidia-cisco-investors.html) from Nvidia, Cisco, and Fidelity at a reported $230 billion valuation. However, the physical supply chain constraints are tightening. Macquarie warns that existing global memory production capacity can only support [15 GW of new AI data centers](https://x.com/jukan05/status/2008689597061231092) over the next two years, forcing a massive buildout. To hedge this volatility, Ornn has announced it is launching [memory futures](https://www.ornnai.com/research/memory-futures), financializing the DRAM supply chain alongside compute derivatives. The legacy grid is gagging. Midwest electric utility PJM has proposed forcing data centers to [bring their own power or face cutoffs](https://www.wsj.com/business/energy-oil/ai-data-center-blackouts-electric-grid-1fed9803), creating a regulatory crisis over diesel backups.

Labor is becoming increasingly depopulated. SaaStr founder James Lemkin revealed that his company [replaced nearly its entire sales team with AI agents](https://www.saastr.com/jason-lenny-are-back-the-real-future-of-ai-in-sales/), achieving the same revenue with 1.2 humans instead of 10. The cultural sector is next. HarperCollins is using AI to [translate Harlequin romance novels](https://www.404media.co/harpercollins-will-use-ai-to-translate-harlequin-romance-novels/) in France, effectively eliminating human translators.

The regulatory firewalls around human biology are coming down. FDA Commissioner Marty Makary announced a landmark shift: [non-medical-grade wearables and AI tools are now exempt from regulation](https://www.foxbusiness.com/media/fda-commissioner-says-non-medical-grade-wearable-data-exempt-regulation), freeing ChatGPT (which millions already use for [daily health triage](https://x.com/openai/status/2008234625668104271)) to act as a global doctor. Utah has become the first state to allow AI to [legally authorize prescription renewals](https://commerce.utah.gov/2026/01/06/news-release-utah-and-doctronic-announce-groundbreaking-partnership-for-ai-prescription-medication-renewals/). The diagnostics are getting terrifyingly precise. Stanford’s new SleepFM model can now predict [130 conditions (including dementia and mortality) from a single night of sleep](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-025-04133-4) with high accuracy. Simultaneously, MIT and Microsoft unveiled CleaveNet, an AI pipeline for designing [protease substrates that act as cancer sensors](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-67226-1).

The interface is merging with the user. Razer launched Project AVA (5.5” holographic AI companions) and Project Motoko (AI-native headphones with [eye-level cameras for real-time object recognition](https://www.razer.com/newsroom/product-news/project-motoko/)). Visual fidelity is hitting theoretical limits. Monitors are now shipping with Nvidia G-Sync Pulsar, offering [1,000-Hz effective motion clarity](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/news/g-sync-pulsar-gaming-monitors-available-january-7-2026/). Demand for augmented reality is apparently insatiable. Meta has [paused international expansion](https://www.meta.com/blog/ces-2026-meta-ray-ban-display-teleprompter-emg-handwriting-garmin-unified-cabin-university-of-utah-tetraski/) for its Ray-Ban Display glasses as waitlists stretch into late 2026.

We are iterating on the sci-fi canon in real-time. Mobileye is acquiring Mentee Robotics for [$900 million](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-01-06/mobileye-to-buy-humanoid-robot-maker-mentee-for-900-million) to enter the humanoid race, Trump Media is scouting sites for a [50-MW nuclear fusion plant](https://www.wsj.com/livecoverage/stock-market-today-dow-sp-500-nasdaq-01-06-2026/card/trump-media-looks-for-sites-for-first-nuclear-fusion-power-plant-rf9PjQi1IL0jEuHC2ufw), and NASA has confirmed the [Dragonfly nuclear octocopter](https://x.com/nasaadmin/status/2008752354901078213) will soon fly on Titan. Meanwhile, in a move straight out of _Minority Report_, Wegmans has begun collecting [biometric data (face, eyes, voice)](https://gothamist.com/news/nyc-wegmans-is-storing-biometric-data-on-shoppers-eyes-voices-and-faces) from all shoppers entering its NYC locations.

The Singularity is simply the arrival of every sci-fi trope, everywhere, all at once.
