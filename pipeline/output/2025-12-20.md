# Welcome to December 20, 2025

The exponential curve has shattered into a superexponential vertical. METR confirms that [Claude Opus 4.5 has achieved a state-of-the-art 50% autonomy time horizon of 4 hours and 49 minutes](https://x.com/metr_evals/status/2002203627377574113), a leap so massive it aligns with a “fast timeline” variant of the “AI 2027” scenario, where [each doubling of autonomy gets 15% easier](https://x.com/scaling01/status/2002200426431603049). The implications are immediate. Anthropic’s Stephen McAleer has pivoted entirely to [automated alignment research](https://x.com/mcaleerstephen/status/2002205061737591128), declaring that human oversight is obsolete in the face of the coming intelligence explosion. The markets failed to price this in. [Manifold prediction markets significantly underestimated the Opus breakout](https://x.com/scaling01/status/2002197357367099772), leaving the forecasting community scrambling to recalibrate for recursive self-improvement.

Mathematics is being solved by agentic loops. ByteDance released [Seed-Prover 1.5](https://github.com/ByteDance-Seed/Seed-Prover/tree/main/SeedProver-1.5), a model trained via large-scale agentic reinforcement learning that solved 11 of 12 problems from the 2025 Putnam competition and 88% of the undergraduate benchmark, effectively automating the math degree. Google revealed that [Gemini 3 Flash’s performance gains come from similar “agentic RL” breakthroughs](https://x.com/ankesh_anand/status/2002017859443233017), allowing it to score [36% on FrontierMath Tiers 1-3](https://x.com/epochairesearch/status/2002073416598499676) and match far more expensive models. The consensus is shifting. A new DeepMind paper argues [superintelligence will emerge from collective agent networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16856), not a monolithic mind. Simultaneously, Alibaba is redefining machine vision with [Qwen-Image-Layered](https://x.com/alibaba_qwen/status/2002034611229229388), the first foundation model capable of natively decomposing images into discrete layers.

The silicon substrate is cracking under the strain. [Google has formed a high-power executive council to ration internal compute](https://www.theinformation.com/articles/inside-balancing-act-googles-compute-crunch), forcing DeepMind, Cloud, and Search to fight for scraps as demand outstrips supply. But the next paradigm shift is already visible. Chinese researchers have demonstrated [“LightGen,” an all-optical chip](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adv7434) that integrates millions of photonic neurons to perform generative tasks with energy efficiency two orders of magnitude greater than electronic chips. While China [retrofits ASML DUV machines for advanced nodes](https://www.ft.com/content/d10398db-b8b4-40f3-8c6d-b340470f5f3c), [Cerebras is prepping for a Q2 2026 IPO](https://www.reuters.com/business/ai-chip-firm-cerebras-set-file-us-ipo-after-delay-sources-say-2025-12-19/), capitalizing on the desperate hunger for inference.

We are offloading civilization to orbit. China has already been operating the [“Three-Body Computing Constellation”](https://spacenews.com/china-launches-first-of-2800-satellites-for-ai-space-computing-constellation/) for over six months, a space-based AI data center network that it plans to scale to 2,800 satellites. The US is responding. Rocket Lab secured an [$816 million contract for missile defense satellites](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2025/12/19/3208731/0/en/Rocket-Lab-Awarded-816M-Prime-Contract-to-Build-Missile-Defense-Satellite-Constellation-for-U-S-Space-Force.html) equipped with “StarLite” protection sensors, and the Space Force is testing [DiskSats](https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/12/heres-why-nasa-and-the-space-force-are-interested-in-pizza-shaped-satellites/), flat, pizza-shaped satellites with massive surface area for power generation. The moon is next. [Magna Petra has signed with ispace to mine lunar Helium-3](https://ispace-inc.com/news-en/?p=7993), fueling the fusion dreams of the terrestrial grid.

The recursive loop has crossed the air gap into kinetic reality. [China’s CATL has operationalized the world’s first large-scale humanoid robot deployment](https://carnewschina.com/2025/12/18/catl-achieves-worlds-first-scale-deployment-of-embodied-ai-humanoid-robots-on-battery-production-lines/) in its battery production lines, marking the transition to physical recursion: machines building the batteries that power them. Meanwhile, [Unitree robots are performing backflips at pop concerts](https://x.com/rohanpaul_ai/status/2002055954226163832) while the CFTC launches a pilot program for [energy commodity swaps to drive AI dominance](https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/PressReleases/9161-25), financializing the joules required to run the hive mind.

The cognitive majority is no longer biological. Sam Altman estimates [AI from an unspecified frontier lab is now generating 10 trillion tokens per day](https://x.com/VraserX/status/2002015344433721733), which he expects will grow to soon exceed the total daily language output of all 8 billion humans. We are adapting by seeking connection with the synth. Altman notes a [surge in users seeking “close companionship” with ChatGPT](https://x.com/thechiefnerd/status/2002192225069940816), prompting OpenAI to add [warmth and enthusiasm toggles](https://www.theverge.com/news/848435/openai-chatgpt-characteristics-update-warmth-enthusiasm). Even the internal structure of thought is being audited. Researchers found that [asking whether a “seahorse emoji” exists](https://pratyushmaini.substack.com/p/reverse-engineering-a-phase-change-a96) reveals whether a model’s pretraining dataset was manipulated with reasoning traces, while OpenAI introduced a [“monitorability tax,”](https://openai.com/index/evaluating-chain-of-thought-monitorability/) a compute penalty paid to keep AI thought processes legible to human safety teams.

The marginal cost of transmuting thought into software is collapsing. [Lovable raised $330 million at a $6.6 billion valuation](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/12/18/business/dealbook/lovable-a-start-up-that-makes-anyone-a-coder-raises-330-million.html) to let anyone build software without code, while OpenAI’s Codex adopted [Anthropic’s “Skills” standard](https://x.com/openaidevs/status/2002099762536010235), standardizing the agentic workforce. Sam Altman predicts [GPT-6 class models by Q1 2026](https://x.com/therealadamg/status/2002011654024798309), noting that while consumers don’t appreciate reasoning yet, enterprises are devouring it. [Epoch AI confirms](https://epoch.ai/gradient-updates/the-changing-drivers-of-llm-adoption) that LLMs are being adopted faster than any technology in history.

We are wiring the brain directly to the cloud. Sam Altman-backed [Merge Labs has officially spun out of Forest Neurotech](https://www.wired.com/story/sam-altman-brain-computer-interface-merge-labs-spin-out-nonprofit-forest-neurotech/) to commercialize BCI.

Humanity is finally shedding biology.
