# Welcome to January 25, 2026

The Singularity is cooking mathematics. GPT-5.2 Pro officially scored a [SOTA 31% on FrontierMath Tier 4](https://x.com/epochairesearch/status/2014769359747744200), a massive jump from the previous 19%. The capability leap is so profound that mathematicians are now increasingly focusing on [understanding cases where the model failed when they expected it to succeed](https://x.com/epochairesearch/status/2014769492409385118). Number theorist Dan Romik notes the model [“beautifully” overcame layers of difficulty](https://x.com/epochairesearch/status/2014769463573537239) that would require a “fairly significant effort” for human experts.

Consequently, the definition of human competence is being rewritten. Anthropic has open-sourced its performance engineering exam because Opus 4.5 beats the best humans under time constraints. They are now inviting applications only from humans who can [beat the model given “infinite time.”](https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/AI-resistant-technical-evaluations) Those applicants will face an uphill battle, now that Anthropic has introduced “Tasks” for Claude Code, allowing it to [track dependencies and collaborate across sessions](https://x.com/trq212/status/2014480496013803643), effectively giving the AI a project management cortex.

Scientific velocity is becoming a function of silicon. A Nature study finds that scientists using AI publish [3.02x more papers and receive 4.84x more citations](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-09922-y), effectively bifurcating the academy into augmented and obsolete factions. At the same time, reality is becoming a generative stream. Odyssey released Odyssey-2 Pro, a real-time world model capable of running for minutes and [streaming 720p video at 22 FPS](https://odyssey.ml/the-gpt-2-moment-for-world-models), aiming for years of continuous simulation. Reasoning is extending to the law. GPT-5.2 Thinking scored a [SOTA 52% on the new “prinzbench” legal reasoning benchmark](https://github.com/prinz-ai/prinzbench/), locating obscure information that highly paid associates often miss.

Even bathroom supply chains are reorganizing around the intelligence explosion. Shares of Toto, the Japanese toilet maker, [surged 11%](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-01-22/japan-toilet-maker-toto-s-shares-get-unlikely-boost-from-ai-rush) because its electrostatic chucks are critical for NAND chipmaking needed for AI infrastructure. SanDisk stock is up [~1,000% in five months](https://sherwood.news/markets/inside-sandisks-transformation-from-thumb-drive-dinosaur-to-the-hottest/) on AI memory demand, while Intel admits it was [caught off guard by the demand for server CPUs](https://www.reuters.com/business/intel-forecasts-first-quarter-sales-profit-below-estimates-2026-01-22/).

For those who expected [Gattaca’s](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gattaca) genetic perfection to unlock the stars, GLP-1s are already delivering a more immediate benefit at liftoff. Jefferies forecasts that US airlines will save [$579 million in fuel costs](https://www.travelweekly.com/Travel-News/Airline-News/Weight-loss-pills-could-fuel-airline-savings) this year simply because new weight-loss drugs are making passengers light enough to save jet fuel. Meanwhile, the “mad scientist” archetype has returned. He Jiankui, fresh from Chinese prison for creating CRISPR babies, is raising capital to [gene-edit embryos for Alzheimer’s resistance](https://www.wired.com/story/china-he-jiankui-gene-editing-alzheimers/) in South Africa. In more standard care, the Apple Watch is now [4x better at detecting heart rhythm disorders](https://www.usnews.com/news/health-news/articles/2026-01-23/smartwatches-help-detect-hidden-dangerous-heart-rhythm-problems-clinical-trial-finds) than standard medical protocols.

Energy consumption is decoupling from recent Western norms. China consumed [10.4 trillion kWh in 2025](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-01-17/china-consumed-twice-the-electricity-of-the-us-in-2025-cctv), double the US total, driven by a 17% jump in data center load. In response to this hunger, TEPCO has [restarted a nuclear reactor at Kashiwazaki-Kariwa](https://www.nbcnews.com/world/asia/japans-tepco-restarts-nuclear-reactor-first-time-fukushima-rcna255161) for the first time since Fukushima. The clean energy transition is uneven but real. In the EU, [wind and solar finally overtook fossil fuels](https://www.semafor.com/article/01/22/2026/solar-and-wind-overtake-fossil-fuels-in-the-eu).

The physical world is being upgraded to a managed runtime. Waymo has expanded its autonomous mesh to [Miami](https://www.cnbc.com/2026/01/22/waymo-launches-robotaxi-service-in-miami-extending-us-lead.html), marking its sixth commercial market. We are also installing observability tools for the atmosphere. Researchers have achieved [near real-time seismic tracking of shockwaves](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adz4676) from space debris re-entry. We are even running garbage collection on the water supply. Rice University has unveiled filtration technology that absorbs [PFAS “forever chemicals” at 100 times the previous rate](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2026/jan/23/pfas-forever-chemicals-filtration).

Storytelling is being refactored for the second screen. Netflix is reportedly instructing filmmakers to [repeat plot points 3-4 times](https://www.nme.com/news/film/netflix-tells-directors-to-repeat-plot-for-people-using-phones-while-watching-says-matt-damon-3924120) because audiences are scrolling on their phones. To recapture that gaze, Sphere Entertainment is planning a [second immersive sphere venue in National Harbor](https://investor.sphereentertainmentco.com/press-releases/news-details/2026/Sphere-Entertainment-the-State-of-Maryland-Prince-Georges-County-and-Peterson-Companies-Announce-Intent-to-Develop-a-Sphere-at-National-Harbor/default.aspx), near DC.

The friction between human and agentic commerce is sparking. eBay is attempting to [ban AI agents from making purchases](https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2026/01/ebay-bans-illicit-automated-shopping-amid-rapid-rise-of-ai-agents/) without direct human supervision, a move that parallels the broader junior-senior bifurcation of the human labor market. Recruiter Reed reports new graduate job postings have [collapsed from 180,000 to 55,000](https://www.ft.com/content/c89496b1-bc8d-425e-b86b-ec89402410e4), yet 40% of executives report [saving over 8 hours a week](https://www.wsj.com/lifestyle/workplace/ceos-say-ai-is-making-work-more-efficient-employees-tell-a-different-story-6613ce9d) using AI. Meanwhile, China’s population contracted by another [3.39 million](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2026/jan/19/china-population-falls-again-birthrate-record-low) in 2025, reaching the lowest birth rate since records began in 1949 and forcing a rush to replace humans with automation. Back in America, as a hedge against macro volatility, US states like Texas and New Hampshire are creating their own [Bitcoin strategic reserves](https://www.cnbc.com/2026/01/17/texas-us-states-budgets-bitcoin-crypto-strategic-reserve.html). Nonetheless, Elon Musk predicts the world’s first [$100 trillion company](https://x.com/elonmusk/status/2014751180912525747) is coming within a decade.

The invisible hand has finally attached itself to a robotic arm.
