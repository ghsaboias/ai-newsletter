# Welcome to December 30, 2025

The service economy is facing an AI margin call. [Meta has effectively acquired Manus](https://www.facebook.com/business/news/manus-joins-meta-accelerating-ai-innovation-for-businesses) for reportedly [over $2 billion](https://www.wsj.com/tech/ai/meta-buys-ai-startup-manus-adding-millions-of-paying-users-f1dc7ef8), [apparently valuing the startup’s ability to automate complex remote work](https://x.com/alexandr_wang/status/2005766785237410107) at roughly $1 billion per percentage point of the [Remote Labor Index (RLI)](https://www.remotelabor.ai/). The RLI, a Scale AI benchmark comprising real-world, economically valuable projects across multiple sectors, saw Manus hit a SOTA 2.5%, edging out Groq 4 (2.1%) and GPT-5 (1.7%). With the market apparently pricing total remote labor automation at an outrageously low $80 billion, on margin, technological deflation is in the air.

The architecture of cognition is finding new gears. Stanford researchers achieved a breakthrough in [continual learning via test-time training](https://test-time-training.github.io/e2e.pdf), allowing models to learn from next-token prediction with constant latency regardless of context length. Optimization is fractal. The NanoGPT speedrun record dropped, yet again, to [115.1 seconds](https://x.com/classiclarryd/status/2005659526960492638). New Asian frontier labs are coming online every day. SK Telecom launched [South Korea’s first 500B model, “A.X K1,”](https://www.chosun.com/english/industry-en/2025/12/28/NH3FKBZ2TVEONFGVQKHHDOAKYQ/) establishing a “sovereign AI foundation.” Meanwhile, corporate adoption is becoming mandatory. [Notion is building custom employee agents](https://www.testingcatalog.com/notion-develops-custom-ai-agents-to-power-your-ai-first-organisation/), and Microsoft is literally [paying customers to train staff on Copilot](https://www.theinformation.com/articles/applied-ai-microsoft-offers-training-funds-copilot-ai-customers).

The gravitational pull of AI infrastructure is bending reality. Taiwanese funeral service company Tien Pin has reportedly [pivoted entirely to AI chip cooling](https://x.com/semianalysis_/status/2005664175914160540) to solve thermal loops for advanced servers. The silicon fabric is densifying. TSMC has “quietly” begun [volume production of N2 gate-all-around chips](https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/semiconductors/tsmc-begins-quietly-volume-production-of-2nm-class-chips-first-gaa-transistor-for-tsmc-claims-up-to-15-percent-improvement-at-iso-power), claiming 15% speed gains, while Samsung accelerates its [2-nm output in Texas](https://wccftech.com/samsung-drops-4nm-plans-for-its-taylor-plant-to-focus-on-2nm-wafer-production/), raising targets to 50,000 wafers. Nvidia is cementing its hegemony, purchasing a [$5 billion stake in Intel](https://www.reuters.com/legal/transactional/nvidia-takes-5-billion-stake-intel-under-september-agreement-2025-12-29/) as a lifeline. Energy markets are adapting. The DOE is empowering FERC to [fast-track data center power connections](https://www.wsj.com/politics/policy/ai-state-federal-data-center-energy-9753e3ce), while Denmark energized [Northern Europe’s largest solar battery park](https://interestingengineering.com/energy/northern-europes-largest-solar-battery-park) at 200 MWh.

We are hacking the biological kernel. Sam Altman’s Retro Bio is [dosing healthy humans with AI-discovered RTR242](https://www.corememory.com/p/exclusive-retro-hopes-it-has-found-alzheimers-trial) to clear Alzheimer’s waste by rejuvenating cells. Weizmann researchers found “DARE” cells that [survive heavy irradiation](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-65996-2), identifying a caspase-based “phoenix switch” for wound repair. Insilico Medicine [IPO’d in Hong Kong](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-12-30/ai-drug-firm-insilico-debuts-in-hong-kong-after-293-million-ipo) to double its pipeline. The FDA is [contracting directly with VCs](https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/fda-explores-new-contracting-approach-advance-public-health-innovation) to bypass bureaucracy, while Fractyl Health seeks approval for a [device that mimics GLP-1 drugs](https://spectrum.ieee.org/weight-loss-devices) by rewiring the duodenum via endoscopy. Even lower back pain is being solved; Vertanical’s cannabis extract [beat opioids in Phase 3 trials](https://www.wsj.com/health/wellness/lower-back-pain-treatment-cannabis-fcf22d0e). Amidst the upgrades, [US life expectancy hit a record high](https://www.noahpinion.blog/p/ten-things-that-are-going-right-in).

We are also finally mapping the hardware of the mind. KAIST researchers identified the [prefrontal cortex mechanism for separating goals from uncertainty](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-66677-w), extracting a blueprint for more flexible AI. Harvard’s new “SmartEM” technique has accelerated [connectome imaging by 7-fold](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41592-025-02929-3). The physics of information is burrowing into the economy. While MIT develops [quantum-secure multi-party deep learning](https://journals.aps.org/prx/abstract/10.1103/k8wg-qmbh) using light, Element Six is pivoting from drill bits to [quantum diamonds](https://www.ft.com/content/0b309cd2-aa74-428e-b37b-067665ef17ea).

The Space Age is back with a vengeance. JAXA and Toyota are building a [pressurized “space station on wheels”](https://x.com/ts86142/status/2003119180045054237) for the Moon, securing seats for Japanese astronauts. Closer to home, Jetson held the [world’s first flying car race](https://jetson.com/news/jetson-UP.Summit-2025), Amazon flying drones are [delivering in Detroit](https://www.instagram.com/reel/DSx-_fQEmaM/), and the RAI Institute built a [robotic mountain bike](https://rai-inst.com/resources/blog/designing-wheeled-robotic-systems/) that combines wheels and legs.

Some human operators are getting squeezed. [Resumes now have a 0.4% chance of success](https://www.businessinsider.com/technology-broke-job-market-ats-recruiters-hiring-application-2025-11) as AI spam floods recruiters, while the accreditation layer collapses. The world’s largest accounting body, the ACCA, has [ended online exams](https://www.ft.com/content/52e70f3e-d0e8-462c-8ac1-f08a684dfca2) because AI makes cheating undetectable. Yet, the loop is creating new high-value nodes. Expert annotators are now [earning $90/hour](https://www.economist.com/business/2025/12/14/job-apocalypse-not-yet-ai-is-creating-brand-new-occupations) to feed the machine via platforms like Mercor.

Money is becoming programmable. China’s central bank will [pay interest on digital yuan](https://www.theblock.co/post/383824/china-interest-digital-yuan), transitioning it to a deposit currency, while US AI startups raised a [record $150 billion](https://www.ft.com/content/7f989b72-0722-4b0a-9a50-876417abc06f) this year. Meanwhile, in the Amazon, [stingless bees were granted legal rights](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/dec/29/stingless-bees-from-the-amazon-granted-legal-rights-in-world-first).

Don’t blink, the Singularity moves pretty fast.
