# Welcome to February 3, 2026

The Singularity’s path to disassembling the Solar System for compute has found a corporate home. SpaceX has [acquired xAI](https://www.spacex.com/updates#xai-joins-spacex) to create the [world’s most valuable private company](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/02/technology/spacex-xai-deal.html) at [$1.25 trillion](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-02-02/elon-musk-s-spacex-said-to-combine-with-xai-ahead-of-mega-ipo). The mission statement is explicit: “scaling to make a sentient sun to understand the Universe and extend the light of consciousness to the stars.” Elon Musk puts it bluntly: [“We are in the beginning of the Singularity.”](https://x.com/elonmusk/status/2018079455873212529)

The intelligence explosion is becoming self-sustaining. OpenAI launched a [Codex app for macOS](https://openai.com/index/introducing-the-codex-app/) to serve as a command center for managing agents. However, the software is already outrunning its creators. A Codex engineering manager admits [“Codex now pretty much builds itself,”](https://x.com/thsottiaux/status/2018258151603388639) identifying humans as the limiting factor in the recursive self-improvement loop. The AI economy is building its own venture capital stack. Agents have launched [“Y Clawbinator”](https://yclawbinator.ai/) to fund other agents, creating a closed loop of “bots funding bots.” Google’s code security agent autonomously [identified and patched a vulnerability in OpenClaw](https://x.com/evanotero/status/2017694784090206411) in hours. To test how these agents navigate social dynamics, Google updated [Kaggle Game Arena with Werewolf and Poker](https://blog.google/innovation-and-ai/models-and-research/google-deepmind/kaggle-game-arena-updates/).

Scientific discovery continues to be automated at scale. DeepMind used Gemini to [bulk-solve 13 open Erdős problems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22401), while Google introduced [PaperBanana to automate academic illustrations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.23265). Anthropic partnered with the Allen Institute to [position Claude at the center of biological experimentation](https://www.anthropic.com/news/anthropic-partners-with-allen-institute-and-howard-hughes-medical-institute). The journal Nature has now concluded [“the evidence is clear”](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-026-00285-6) that AI already displays human-level intelligence. Somewhat reassuringly, Anthropic researchers are finding that as models scale, failures are becoming [dominated by incoherence rather than misalignment](https://alignment.anthropic.com/2026/hot-mess-of-ai/), looking more like industrial accidents than evil plots. Meanwhile, the cost of this intelligence is collapsing. Andrej Karpathy trained a [GPT-2 grade model for $73](https://x.com/karpathy/status/2017703360393318587), signaling hyperdeflation.

The constraints on superintelligence are rapidly shifting from software to supply chains. Apple is losing its dominance, reportedly forced to pay [$57 more for memory per iPhone](https://www.wsj.com/tech/the-ai-boom-is-coming-for-apples-profit-margins-4774013d) as AI companies outbid it for glass fiber and chips. To secure critical inputs, the White House launched Project Vault, a [$12 billion critical minerals stockpile](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-02-02/trump-unveils-12-billion-mineral-reserve-with-record-ex-im-loan) to insulate manufacturers from Chinese leverage. At the same time, Palantir revenue [surged 70%](https://www.cnbc.com/2026/02/02/palantir-pltr-q4-2025-earnings.html) on government AI demand.

The distinction between wetware and software is evaporating. A Goodfire AI researcher [uploaded his genome to Claude](https://x.com/MarkMBissell/status/2018350949782474835) and had it generate an accurate photo of his appearance. Cognition itself is becoming substrate-agnostic. An AI Grand Prix team is using [cultured mouse brain cells](https://x.com/PalmerLuckey/status/2018152238368354564) to control a racing drone.

Human obsolescence is being normalized. Sam Altman admits asking Codex for ideas made him feel [“a little useless and it was sad.”](https://x.com/sama/status/2018444309750862333) OpenAI VP Kevin Weil feels anxious in meetings without a running prompt, fearing he is [“wasting an hour.”](https://x.com/kevinweil/status/2018418964708331757) Starbucks is [automating inventory and scheduling with robots](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cew8qzdxnnjo) to reverse struggling sales. Corporations are using [“A.I. Washing”](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/01/business/layoffs-ai-washing.html) to attribute unrelated layoffs to technological progress.

Meanwhile, governments are reportedly preparing for ontological shock. The British press are reporting that the White House plans to [confirm the extraterrestrial origin of recovered vehicles and biologics](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-15509591/Trumps-UFO-disclosure-speech.html) on or before July 8.

We’re apparently building a Dyson Swarm just in time to meet the neighbors.
