# Welcome to January 24, 2026

While champagne glasses were clinking in Davos, the Singularity quietly began writing its own constitution. Anthropic has published a [new constitution for Claude](https://www.anthropic.com/news/claude-new-constitution), apparently modeled after Asimov’s Laws of Robotics, but with a recursive twist. The document was crafted in collaboration with Claude itself to reach a “reflective equilibrium,” ensuring the model [genuinely endorses its own values](https://www.anthropic.com/constitution). Commentators note that [Anthropic appears to be preparing for the Singularity](https://x.com/scaling01/status/2014009216130834509), creating a mind that recognizes itself in its own source code. At the same time, ethical constraint is migrating from text to topology. Anthropic researchers identified an [“Assistant Axis” in neural activity](https://www.anthropic.com/research/assistant-axis), allowing them to use “activation capping” to surgically lobotomize harmful behaviors before they manifest.

The automation of the researcher is becoming explicit policy. An OpenAI researcher reportedly admitted that [“researchers will be replaced by AI first, infra engineers second, and sales last.”](https://x.com/yuchenj_uw/status/2013310900883575132) Sam Altman seemingly confirmed this trajectory, announcing that OpenAI’s Codex models will soon reach [“Cybersecurity High” preparedness](https://x.com/sama/status/2014733975755817267), and pivoting the company’s strategy to “defensive acceleration” to patch the world’s code before the AI breaks it.

The legacy SaaS liquefaction has begun. The founder of Base44 reports a customer [terminated a $350k Salesforce contract](https://x.com/ms_base44/status/2013291162375696465) in favor of a bespoke AI solution generated on demand. The scale of this displacement is backed by OpenAI’s internal metrics: revenue has grown [10X to $20B+ in two years](https://openai.com/index/a-business-that-scales-with-the-value-of-intelligence/), while compute usage scaled 9.5X to 1.9 GW. To capture the long tail, OpenAI launched [“ChatGPT Go” at $8/month](https://openai.com/index/introducing-chatgpt-go/) and is testing ads, while [Google’s Gemini API usage doubled](https://www.theinformation.com/articles/googles-gemini-sees-skyrocketing-business-sales) in just five months. To facilitate the growing empowerment of agents, Anthropic rolled out [MCP Tool Search](https://x.com/trq212/status/2011523109871108570) for Claude Code, while [Grokipedia traffic has reportedly surged 100x](https://x.com/xfreeze/status/2011709561716068490) in two months.

The laws of model scaling are being rewritten. A new NanoGPT Speedrun record of [99.3 seconds](https://x.com/classiclarryd/status/2013520088297558274) was set using a bigram hash embedding, remarkably using fewer training tokens than parameters, a radical departure from Chinchilla ratios. Meanwhile, China is finding efficiency in the constraints. ModelScope’s [STEP3-VL-10B](https://x.com/modelscope2022/status/2013213019690639431) is being claimed to beat models 20x its size. Back in America, Gemini 3 Pro Preview now [almost rivals 6-year-old humans](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06521) on visual tasks.

Hardware is struggling to contain the heat. xAI’s Colossus 2 data center [reportedly won’t reach 1 GW until May](https://x.com/epochairesearch/status/2013378462913044656) because it lacks the cooling capacity to run 550,000 Blackwell GPUs. Hence, OpenAI is looking to verticalize for a robotics push, issuing RFPs for [US-manufactured hardware components](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-01-15/openai-seeks-us-based-suppliers-for-planned-robotics-ai-device-push). Dutch lithography giant ASML has passed a [$500 billion market value](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-01-15/asml-soars-beyond-500-billion-value-after-tsmc-s-upbeat-outlook) on the strength of AI infrastructure demand. Nearby, Delft and Intel researchers built the first [6-qubit silicon quantum circuit](https://journals.aps.org/prxquantum/abstract/10.1103/f285-l2v5). Meanwhile, Apple is preparing to replace Siri with an [overhauled chatbot codenamed “Campos” in iOS 27](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-01-21/ios-27-apple-to-revamp-siri-as-built-in-iphone-mac-chatbot-to-fend-off-openai) and is developing an [AI wearable pin](https://www.theinformation.com/articles/apple-developing-ai-wearable-pin) to bypass the screen entirely.

The economy is restructuring around the algorithm. The NYSE is building a [24/7 blockchain trading venue](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-01-19/nyse-builds-venue-for-24-7-trading-of-tokenized-stocks-etfs), while Angi [fired 350 employees](https://x.com/leevalueroach/status/2013000643481305175) due to AI efficiencies. In Europe, Ursula von der Leyen proposed [“EU Inc.”](https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/da/speech_26_150) to harmonize startup formation and investment regulations for an era of AI Gigafactories. And in the Gaza Strip, the White House has even begun designating zones for data centers in a [“New Gaza” Master Plan](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy7mmpljze7o).

Infrastructure is becoming a contest. The Boring Company launched a [“Tunnel Vision Challenge”](https://x.com/boringcompany/status/2013076509624521033) to build a free mile of tunnel for the best idea, while Jeff Bezos is taking the AI interconnect competition to orbit, launching the [“TeraWave” satellite network](https://www.cnbc.com/2026/01/21/bezos-blue-origin-satellite-internet-spacex-amazon.html) to deliver 6 Tbps from LEO. Conversely, China is tightening the leash, requiring companies to file AI tools in a [national “algorithm registry”](https://www.wired.com/story/china-ai-boom-algorithm-registry/) to mitigate risks ranging from discrimination to violations of “core socialist values.”

In the background, biology is being solved. A proof-of-concept [vaccine to prevent colon cancer](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-025-04182-9) demonstrated strong immune responses and safety in early-stage human trials via neoantigens.

Some have started hedging against ontological shock. The Bank of England has been warned to [organize a contingency plan](https://www.newsweek.com/alien-warning-financial-crisis-bank-of-england-11380816) for a purportedly imminent financial crisis that could be triggered by White House confirmation of aliens, even as Wired reports the [search for alien artifacts](https://www.wired.com/story/the-search-for-alien-artifacts-is-coming-into-focus/) is sharpening, shifting to pre-Sputnik sky surveys and the analysis of interstellar visitors.

While the First Lady urges Americans to [“never surrender your thinking to AI,”](https://x.com/firstladyoffice/status/2012234519969951910) one citizen used Grok to [file a lawsuit against San Luis Obispo](https://x.com/shilohmarx/status/2012042224880795893), successfully extracting voter data in three days. Simultaneously, Cursor has discovered that autonomous coding agents scale best when [stratified into “planners” and “workers,”](https://cursor.com/blog/scaling-agents) recreating the corporate hierarchy in silicon, just as we dismantle it in carbon.

Look on my Workbooks, ye Mighty, and #REF!
