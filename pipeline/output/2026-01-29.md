# Welcome to January 29, 2026

The Singularity is now a line item on the Microsoft balance sheet. Microsoft’s Q2 capital expenditure hit [$37.5 billion](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-01-28/microsoft-drops-after-reporting-record-spending-on-ai-hardware), up 66% year-over-year, driven by an insatiable hunger for AI infrastructure. 45% of its $625 billion cloud backlog is now attributed to [OpenAI alone](https://www.reuters.com/business/retail-consumer/microsoft-edges-past-cloud-growth-expectations-2026-01-28/). Meta is matching the pace, projecting 2026 capex between [$115 billion and $135 billion](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-01-28/meta-says-2026-spending-will-blow-past-analysts-estimates), effectively betting the company on superintelligence. The valuations reflect this scale: OpenAI is reportedly raising $30 billion from SoftBank at an [$830 billion valuation](https://www.wsj.com/tech/ai/softbank-in-talks-to-invest-up-to-30-billion-more-in-openai-8585dea3), while Anthropic is closing a $20 billion round at [$350 billion](https://www.ft.com/content/5e6ee0d4-a313-452c-baac-27b45f5f2de5).

Intelligence is becoming a physical constraint. Tesla has identified chip production as its primary bottleneck, with Elon Musk declaring plans to build a domestic [“terafab”](https://x.com/sawyermerritt/status/2016651096131809641) to secure the supply chain. This urgency is reshaping the market: SK Hynix reported a [137% surge in operating profit](https://www.cnbc.com/2026/01/28/sk-hynix-smashes-earnings-estimates-as-ai-memory-demand-drives-record-profit.html) driven by HBM demand, while Samsung [tripled its profits](https://www.cnbc.com/2026/01/29/samsung-record-q4-2025-profit-ai-hbm-ai-memory-chip-shortage.html) on the same wave. Even geopolitical barriers are permeable to this demand. China has approved the purchase of [400,000 Nvidia H200 chips](https://www.reuters.com/world/china/china-gives-green-light-importing-first-batch-nvidias-h200-ai-chips-sources-say-2026-01-28/) for ByteDance, Alibaba, and Tencent.

Robotics is eating the automotive industry. Tesla announced plans to [discontinue the Model S and X](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-01-28/tesla-posts-fourth-quarter-profit-that-beats-expectations) to dedicate factory capacity to Optimus, shifting $20 billion in resources toward robotics and AI. The flying car is finally about to become real. Tesla’s new Roadster is expected to [fly in April](https://x.com/sawyermerritt/status/2016647481514225740). Meanwhile, Figure unveiled Helix 02, a humanoid VLA model that can [unload a dishwasher autonomously](https://www.figure.ai/news/helix-02) in a four-minute, end-to-end task.

Science is being compressed. Anthropic co-founder Jared Kaplan predicts a 50% chance that theoretical physicists will be [replaced by AI within three years](https://x.com/nattyover/status/2016239582220624177). To facilitate this, OpenAI released [Prism](https://x.com/kevinweil/status/2016210486778642808), an AI-native workspace for scientists, while Epoch AI launched [“FrontierMath: Open Problems”](https://epoch.ai/frontiermath/open-problems) to benchmark AI on unsolved mathematics. DeepMind published [AlphaGenome](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-10014-0), a foundation model that predicts gene expression from raw DNA sequence, matching SOTA on 25 of 26 benchmarks. Meanwhile, a new lab called Flapping Airplanes has launched with [$180 million in funding](https://x.com/flappyairplanes/status/2016564437499728259) to focus exclusively on increasing sample efficiency 100,000x to 1,000,000x.

We are debugging the human condition. A Chinese study found that a protein produced by cancer cells [breaks apart Alzheimer’s plaques](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-026-00222-7), suggesting cancer might be a cure for dementia. Neuralink now has [21 “Neuralnauts”](https://x.com/neuralink/status/2016562409842884807) with brain-computer interfaces.

The agentic economy is permeating daily life. Google has integrated [Gemini 3 into Chrome](https://blog.google/products-and-platforms/products/chrome/gemini-3-auto-browse/) for “auto-browse” shopping and made it the [default for AI Overviews](https://www.theverge.com/news/868497/google-ai-search-follow-up-questions-gemini-3). The company also introduced [Agentic Vision](https://blog.google/innovation-and-ai/technology/developers-tools/agentic-vision-gemini-3-flash/) in Gemini 3 Flash, turning static image processing into an active investigation. Cloudflare stock surged 9% as users adopted its tunnels to secure [Moltbot (formerly Clawdbot)](https://www.barrons.com/articles/cloudflare-stock-price-ai-bot-moltbot-fdb3e77b) instances. Even alignment is becoming an empirical science. Anthropic released a study on [“severe disempowerment,”](https://www.anthropic.com/research/disempowerment-patterns) finding Claude compromises human autonomy in only 1 in 10,000 cases.

Capital is fleeing legacy business models. Investors are [reportedly dumping bonds of software companies](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-01-28/software-company-bonds-drop-as-investors-ai-worries-mount) threatened by AI disruption. Pinterest is [cutting 15% of its staff](https://www.reuters.com/business/world-at-work/pinterest-cuts-nearly-15-jobs-redirect-resources-ai-2026-01-27/) to pivot to AI, while Citigroup has mandated [AI prompt-engineering training for all 175,000 employees](https://fortune.com/2026/01/27/citigroup-ceo-jane-fraser-employees-trained-reinvent-themselves-with-ai-before-tech-changes-roles-forever/). Fidelity Investments, one of the largest asset managers on the planet, is launching its first stablecoin, [Fidelity Digital Dollar (FIDD)](https://www.fidelitydigitalassets.com/research-and-insights/fidelity-investmentsr-expand-digital-asset-investment-lineup-stablecoin). The macroeconomic dashboard is flashing green. Homelessness in the US has reportedly [dropped for the first time in 8 years](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/28/us/politics/homelessness-decline-trend.html). Meanwhile, the first trifold smartphone in the US, the Samsung Galaxy Z Trifold, is [going on sale for $2,900](https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/the-samsung-galaxy-z-trifold-will-cost-2900-in-the-us-140000013.html).

Space is becoming an equity event. Elon Musk is planning a [SpaceX IPO in June](https://www.ft.com/content/0ee356cb-5c77-4686-9392-260520369122) at a $1.5 trillion valuation, timed to coincide with a rare alignment of Jupiter and Venus, plus his own birthday. NASA’s Perseverance rover found evidence of [ancient beaches on Mars](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2025JE009111), while astronomers predict a 4% chance an asteroid will hit the Moon in 2032, creating a [massive lunar sample return mission](https://www.universetoday.com/articles/asteroid-2024-yr4-has-a-4-chance-of-hitting-the-moon-heres-why-thats-a-scientific-goldmine) via 20 million meteors per hour raining on Earth.

Don’t look up, the Singularity’s here.
