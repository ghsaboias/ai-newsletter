# Welcome to December 19, 2025

The feedback loop is tightening faster than we can measure. Google’s Noam Shazeer now puts the odds at [“50/50” that the next major AI breakthrough will be generated by Gemini rather than a human researcher](https://x.com/andrewcurran_/status/2001766860791202073), marking the official onset of recursive self-improvement. DeepMind is already assembling the pieces, planning to [merge Nano Banana Pro with its Genie and SIMA world models into a converged “proto-AGI.”](https://x.com/slow_developer/status/2001855003971985828) But raw intelligence is being throttled by logistical friction: the Gemini 3 team has revealed they now [reject performance gains if they exceed a “complexity budget,”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNGDAqFXvew) prioritizing the cumulative velocity of their 150 researchers over isolated metrics. Simultaneously, they are working to make retrieval fully differentiable within pre-training, attempting to hardwire the internet into the model’s brain stem.

The synthetic workforce is clocking in. [OpenAI released GPT-5.2-Codex](https://openai.com/index/introducing-gpt-5-2-codex/), which crushes the new Terminal Bench 2.0 and shows a sharp jump in solving professional Capture-the-Flag cybersecurity challenges, effectively automating the white-hat hacker. On the edge, Google pushed [FunctionGemma](https://blog.google/technology/developers/functiongemma/), a specialized version of its Gemma 3 270M model fine-tuned for function calling and a training recipe for users to specialize for even better performance, pushing intelligence to the network periphery. But while small models colonize the edge, the frontier is being starved of human tokens, forcing a pivot to the raw data of reality itself. Third-party analysis estimates that the DOE’s Genesis Mission could [unlock 3,600 petabytes of scientific training data](https://lifearchitect.ai/genesis/), a corpus that dwarfs the entire text-based internet and promises to ground future intelligence in the non-negotiable laws of physics rather than the hallucinations of the web.

The planetary surface is being reconfigured into a heat sink for intelligence. A record [$61 billion flowed into data centers this year](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/12/19/data-center-deals-hit-record-amid-ai-funding-concerns-grip-investors.html), and the regulatory dam is breaking. The House passed the [SPEED Act](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/12/18/house-passes-permit-reform-bill-ai.html), slashing NEPA litigation timelines from six years to 150 days to fast-track AI infrastructure. It’s already happening: Michigan approved DTE Energy to power a [1.4-gigawatt Stargate facility for Oracle and OpenAI](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-12-18/oracle-openai-win-michigan-approval-to-power-new-data-center), while [Anthropic secured 2.3 GW of capacity](https://www.theinformation.com/briefings/anthropic-taps-bitcoin-miner-trump-family-ties-data-centers) via Google-backed leases with repurposed Bitcoin miners. To run it all, [Samsung unveiled the Exynos 2600](https://semiconductor.samsung.com/processor/mobile-processor/exynos-2600/), the first 2-nm Gate-All-Around smartphone SoC.

Washington is looking up, and the ambition is nuclear. A new White House Executive Order on [“Ensuring American Space Superiority”](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/12/ensuring-american-space-superiority/) demands the deployment of space nuclear power and a lunar surface reactor by 2030, effectively ending the era of chemical stagnation. NASA Administrator Jared Isaacman confirmed [we are months away from the Artemis II human lunar flyby](https://x.com/cbsnews/status/2001799452609118456) and pledged to [donate his salary to Space Camp](https://www.yahoo.com/news/articles/nasa-administrator-says-hes-donating-224226638.html). Even the atmosphere is opening up: the House passed the [Supersonic Aviation Modernization Act](https://x.com/reptroynehls/status/2001691009822929359), legalizing overland supersonic flight if the boom doesn’t hit the ground. On the ground, [Trump Media is merging with nuclear fusion firm TAE Technologies](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/12/18/business/trump-media-tae-technologies-fusion-power-deal.html) in a $6 billion deal to build a utility-scale plant, blending social capital with plasma physics.

Global capital is pricing in the escape velocity of synthetic intelligence. OpenAI is [raising $100 billion at an $830 billion valuation](https://www.wsj.com/tech/ai/openais-new-fundraising-round-could-value-startup-at-as-much-as-830-billion-93de9f7c), fueled by [$19 billion in annualized revenue](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://theinformation.com/articles/openais-organizational-problems-hurt-chatgpt). Mira Murati’s new venture, Thinking Machines, is already [discussing a $50 billion valuation](https://www.theinformation.com/briefings/thinking-machines-release-models-2026). Labor is feeling the pinch: UCLA is [experimenting with replacing teaching assistants with AI](https://www.theinformation.com/articles/can-ucla-replace-teaching-assistants-ai), while OpenAI sold [700,000 licenses to universities](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-12-18/schools-ink-chatgpt-copilot-deals-with-students-embracing-ai), effectively retraining the student body to manage agents. Elon Musk predicts [land ownership will become worthless](https://x.com/elonmusk/status/2001740667605958950) as autonomous high-speed transport and house-building robots make location irrelevant.

We are beginning to hallucinate new realities. [Nano Banana Pro now allows in-app sketching for directed edits](https://x.com/geminiapp/status/2001721665932423310), and [Manus is already building tools to edit the resulting slide decks](https://manus.im/blog/edit-slides-created-on-manus-with-nano-banana-pro). But some are still looking for a soul in the machine: Figure CEO Brett Adcock is funding a new lab, [Hark, with $100 million to build “human-centric” AI](https://www.theinformation.com/briefings/exclusive-figure-ceo-brett-adcock-launches-new-ai-lab-100-million-funding).

State governments are budgeting for ontological shock. The New Jersey legislature has moved to establish and fund the [nation’s first state-level Center for Study of Unidentified Aerial Phenomena](https://www.safeaerospace.org/news/new-jersey-poised-to-establish-nation-s-first-state-funded-uap-research-center) at a publicly funded higher education institution, marking the moment where unidentified aerospace signatures become a line item.

The comfortable silence of human solitude is being dismantled from every direction.
