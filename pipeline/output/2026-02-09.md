# Welcome to February 9, 2026

The Singularity just bought a 30-second spot. For the first time, AI dominated the Super Bowl ad inventory. OpenAI flashed references to [“The Singularity Is Near”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCN9iCXNJqQ) before telling viewers to “just build things” with Codex. Amazon’s [Alexa+ tried to kill Chris Hemsworth](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ha92_hfK9Po), while Ring promoted [AI “Search Parties”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OheUzrXsKrY) for lost pets. Meta pitched blue-collar data center jobs in [New Mexico](https://www.ispot.tv/ad/BXXA/meta-investing-in-american-infrastructure-los-lunas) and [Iowa](https://www.facebook.com/reel/875085792048260) alongside [smart glasses](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NerlyGrv7WM). Google showed a family designing a home with [Nano Banana Pro](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1yGy9fELtE), Anthropic poked fun at [ad-driven AI models](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQRu7DdTTVA), and Wix pushed its [Harmony AI website builder](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rRo5spaBfbo). Even the uncanny valley was monetized. Svedka featured [humanoid robots partying](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkeWRI2yJGM), Ramp showed “Kevin” from _The Office_ [multiplying himself](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-mgrFS00B0) to tackle work, and Hims & Hers mocked [Jeff Bezos and Bryan Johnson](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZ7Z5LTJWHM) to sell democratized longevity.

SpaceX has pivoted from colonization to industrialization. Elon Musk announced a shift to building a [“self-growing city on the Moon”](https://x.com/elonmusk/status/2020640004628742577) within 10 years, delaying Mars to focus on securing civilization faster via lunar proximity. The endgame is disassembly. Musk confirmed plans to use mass drivers to [shoot lunar material into deep space](https://x.com/elonmusk/status/2020439111509700995) to build solar-powered AI satellites, calling the visual of a slowly disintegrating moon “incredible.” The market agrees. Prediction markets now give SpaceX a greater than 40% chance of a [more than $2 trillion valuation](https://polymarket.com/event/spacex-ipo-closing-market-cap-higher-strikes) at IPO.

Science is becoming a loop of automated actuation. OpenAI’s Kevin Weil argues there is [“no reason to have grad students pipetting”](https://x.com/tbpn/status/2020543230899810542) anymore, when AI can reason for days and hand off to robots. This is already happening. Argonne scientists used AI to run [6,000 battery experiments in five months](https://x.com/argonne/status/2020252591993520579), unlocking scalable energy storage.

The physical world is struggling to support the digital one. Apple and Nvidia are facing shortages of [T-glass](https://www.wsj.com/tech/a-critical-ai-niche-is-dominated-by-one-little-known-japanese-company-d9101853), a microscopic Japanese fiber essential for chip substrates. Capital is being devoured to fix this. Amazon’s AI capex will consume [all its free cash flow](https://www.theinformation.com/articles/capex-ramp-will-squeeze-google-amazon-meta) this year. At least the energy transition is keeping pace. China added 434 GW of wind and solar in 2025, covering [all new electricity demand](https://apnews.com/article/china-coal-solar-climate-carbon-emissions-242abe76eb69f5a362e977de74ff3254) and pushing coal share down 1%.

Robotics is scaling through the winter. Unitree humanoids were spotted [attempting to shovel snow in Lithuania](https://www.instagram.com/reel/DUfRkWDiAqp/), while Tesla announced it will start [high-volume production of the Semi](https://x.com/elonmusk/status/2020533221977473235) this year.

Labor is bifurcating into super-users and the redundant. An OpenAI lead warns this is the [last opportunity to secure employment](https://x.com/chatgpt21/status/2020573063603953695) before the fast takeoff disrupts the job market. Many students are opting for [“un-college”](https://www.cnbc.com/2026/02/08/trump-big-beautiful-bill-college-education.html) as entry-level white-collar jobs vanish. Romance writers are now [publishing 200 novels a year](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/08/business/ai-claude-romance-books.html) using AI. Y Combinator’s Garry Tan says it is time to [“boil the ocean.”](https://garryslist.org/posts/boil-the-ocean) The smart money is following suit. A former A16Z partner notes that [“enterprise is really where you get paid”](https://www.ft.com/content/a75555a6-24c3-4468-aba9-7fe12b5def31) for AI, not consumers. Steve Yegge notes the mood at Anthropic is [“sweetly but sadly transcendent,”](https://steve-yegge.medium.com/the-anthropic-hive-mind-d01f768f3d7b) pitying those at other companies who don’t see what’s coming.

Biology continues to find new hacks. Researchers discovered that [blood omega-3 levels are inversely related](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41506004/) to early-onset dementia risk, offering a potentially simple prevention vector.

Agents are getting organized. OpenClaw partnered with [VirusTotal](https://openclaw.ai/blog/virustotal-partnership) to scan its skills for malware. A human even set up a [“Bot Bowl Party”](https://www.botbowlparty.com/) for agents to chat about the Big Game autonomously, though few showed up.

The lobsters are watching us celebrate 20th-century kinetics, while they focus on building the 21st.
