# Welcome to 2026

The machines have learned to nurture. In an apparent world first, Claude has successfully [monitored and managed the environmental conditions for a growing tomato plant](https://x.com/d33v33d0/status/2006221407340867881), extending its agency from digital text to biological stewardship. Efficiency is making a quantum leap. Chinese firm iQuest claims its 40B-parameter [Coder-V1 model achieves a SOTA 81.4% on SWE-bench Verified](https://github.com/IQuestLab/IQuest-Coder-V1) using a “looped” recurrent transformer, signaling another potential “DeepSeek moment” where algorithmic novelty beats raw scale. We are simultaneously redefining the architecture of thought. Adobe researchers have formalized an [information-theoretic approach for AI to discover concepts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17373) from raw experience, allowing models to understand that definitions like “planet” are fluid structures rather than static database entries.

The physical plant of intelligence is doubling. Elon Musk’s xAI now has [450,000 GPUs online](https://x.com/xaimemphis/status/2006496881502036307), with construction underway to hit 900,000 by Q2. To power this exponential thirst, Goldman Sachs is financing [5 GW of “private power campuses” in Texas](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-12-30/goldman-helps-lead-financing-for-5-gigawatt-texas-ai-power-sites), utilizing modular gas turbines to bypass the grid queue, while Morgan Stanley warns of a [44-GW US power shortfall by 2028](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/morgan-stanley-sees-20-shortage-135922617.html). Financial capital is merging with silicon. Private equity firm Brookfield is launching a [cloud business to lease chips directly to developers](https://www.theinformation.com/articles/brookfield-start-cloud-business-lower-cost-ai), backed by a $10 billion fund.

Hardware is mutating to escape thermal limits. Researchers have developed a [tunable photonic reservoir computing device](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-67983-z) that is approximately 10 times more energy efficient per operation than the best current GPUs. We are archiving the species in molecules. Atlas Data Storage announced [DNA storage with 1,000x the density of tape](https://www.atlasds.com/). Traditional lithography is accelerating. TSMC is expediting its [1.4-nm fabrication plant](https://wccftech.com/tsmc-expediting-1-4nm-production-plant-due-to-improved-yields/) due to better-than-expected yields, while Nvidia scrambles to meet [Chinese demand for 2 million H200 chips](https://www.reuters.com/world/china/nvidia-sounds-out-tsmc-new-h200-chip-order-china-demand-jumps-sources-say-2025-12-31/).

Robotics has crossed the continental threshold. The first [USA coast-to-coast autonomous drive](https://x.com/davidmoss/status/2006255297212358686) has been completed with zero disengagements, echoing the first nonstop transatlantic flight a century ago. Machines are gaining sensitivity. Chinese researchers developed a [neuromorphic robotic e-skin](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2520922122) capable of detecting pain and injury. The battlefield is already laser-lit. Israel has deployed the [first operational 100-kW Iron Beam system](https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/100kw-iron-beam-laser-becomes-worlds-first-drone-defense-zapper-to-be-operationally-deployed-it-can-also-shoot-down-rockets-mortars-and-other-aerial-threats) to zap drones.

We are ramping up manufacturing in the vacuum. British startup Space Forge has sent a [microwave-sized factory into orbit](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c62vx0pgyrgo) that has successfully switched on its furnace to reach 1,000°C, capable of growing semiconductor crystals 4,000 times purer than those on Earth. The orbital mesh is becoming a utility layer. Starlink served [20 million cruise passengers and 21 million airline passengers](https://starlink.com/public-files/starlinkProgressReport_2025.pdf) in 2025.

The economy is pricing in the intelligence explosion. OpenAI, SpaceX, and Anthropic are all reportedly [planning blockbuster IPOs for 2026](https://www.ft.com/content/bf607829-dca5-497d-b1a1-ca945d32a8c6). Yale economists have derived [“Scaling Laws for Economic Impacts,”](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21316) suggesting AI could boost US productivity by 20% over the next decade, a figure that likely represents a wild underestimate. Value is accruing to the builders. OpenAI’s stock-based compensation hit [$1.5 million per employee](https://www.wsj.com/tech/ai/openai-is-paying-employees-more-than-any-major-tech-startup-in-history-23472527), while Scale AI’s remnant reported its [biggest quarter ever](https://x.com/alexandr_wang/status/2006413001293750738). Even office perks are shifting. Palantir has installed [nicotine pouch vending machines](https://www.wsj.com/tech/tech-startups-are-handing-out-free-nicotine-pouches-to-boost-productivity-e42d3cbe) for its engineers.

The interface between brain and machine is entering mass production. Elon Musk says Neuralink will begin [high-volume production and automated surgery in 2026](https://x.com/elonmusk/status/2006513491105165411), streamlining the installation of threads through the dura.

Meanwhile, Leopold Aschenbrenner now argues that [technological growth minimizes existential risk](https://philiptrammell.com/static/Existential_Risk_and_Growth.pdf).

The Singularity is expanding at the speed of thought, and the biggest risk is stopping.
