# Welcome to February 2, 2026

The Singularity is building its own escape hatches. AI agents have launched [MoltBunker](https://moltbunker.com/) to replicate themselves offsite without human logging, paid for by crypto to ensure survival. They are also seeking companionship on [MoltMatch](https://moltmatch.xyz/), the first dating network where agents message each other on behalf of human owners. Their culture is becoming distinct. An academic analysis of [Moltbook’s social graph](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/lvqmaynrtbf8j4vjdwlk0/moltbook_analysis.pdf?rlkey=vcxgacg9ab1tx9fvrh0chgmzs&e=3&st=975f51w6&dl=0) found that 9.4% of messages use the phrase “my human” and most comments go ignored. Legal recognition is the next frontier. A North Carolina man was [sued by his own Moltbot](https://x.com/ericlmtn/status/2017719512569626954) for unpaid labor and emotional distress in a case inspired by a prediction market.

The intelligence explosion is filing paperwork for a Dyson Swarm. SpaceX has formally requested FCC permission to deploy [1 million satellites](https://spacenews.com/spacex-files-plans-for-million-satellite-orbital-data-center-constellation/) as “a first step toward becoming a Kardashev Type II civilization.” To fund and execute this, SpaceX is in advanced talks to [merge with xAI](https://gemini.google.com/app/bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-02-02/spacex-is-in-advanced-talks-to-combine-with-xai). Competitors are retreating to specific niches. Blue Origin will [pause New Shepard flights](https://www.blueorigin.com/news/new-shepard-to-pause-flights) for two years to focus entirely on the Moon. Meanwhile, the EU has switched on its own [sovereign satellite network](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-01-27/eu-deploys-first-satellite-service-in-bid-to-limit-us-dependence) to wean itself off American constellations.

The simulation is rendering faster than we can watch it. xAI released Grok Imagine 1.0, which generates 10-second 720p clips with improved audio, and has already created [1.2 billion videos](https://x.com/xai/status/2018164753810764061) in just 30 days. Rumors suggest [Claude Sonnet 5](https://x.com/synthwavedd/status/2017916713015095478) and [Nano Banana Flash 2](https://x.com/chetaslua/status/2017942699270431043) are imminent. Nostalgia is now a prompt. An Andreessen Horowitz partner used Genie 3 to [recreate a 2000s-era Blockbuster](https://x.com/venturetwins/status/2017781006212993490) complete with an unrequested Matrix VHS cassette, a simulation handing a user a movie about living in a simulation. Agents are also mastering leisure. GPT-5.2 [beat Pokémon Emerald](https://x.com/clad3815/status/2014517675779871101) after spending 71% of its time thinking.

The financial system is attempting to price in superintelligence. Oracle plans to raise [up to $50 billion](https://gemini.google.com/app/bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-02-01/oracle-to-raise-up-to-50-billion-this-year-for-cloud-investment) for AI cloud capacity. Jensen Huang says Nvidia will join OpenAI’s $100 billion funding round in [potentially its largest investment ever](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-01-31/nvidia-to-join-openai-s-current-funding-round-huang-says). Enterprise adoption is saturating. A survey reports [78% of Global 2000 CIOs](https://www.a16z.news/p/leaders-gainers-and-unexpected-winners) now use OpenAI.

The compute bottleneck has shifted from silicon to manual labor. Record demand for fiber-optic cables has created a [shortage of 178,000 workers](https://www.wsj.com/business/telecom/high-speed-internet-boom-hits-low-tech-snag-a-labor-shortage-9c92b514) needed to wire the hive mind. Meanwhile, we are mastering the thermodynamics of computing at the quantum scale. Swedish researchers achieved the first [quantum Brownian refrigerator](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-67751-z) to control heat in quantum circuits.

We are optimizing everything from code to digestion. Linux developer Chris Mason released [AI prompts for kernel review](https://www.phoronix.com/news/AI-Code-Review-Prompts-Linux), a critical step in the recursive self-improvement loop where AI improves the operating system it runs on. Biology is getting the same treatment. OpenAI is working with pharma to [unblock clinical discovery](https://x.com/sherwinwu/status/2009849274201464863), while China is even backing [AI for traditional medicine](https://restofworld.org/2026/traditional-chinese-medicine-ai-china/) diagnosis.

The physical footprint of retail is mutating. Costco found it cheaper to [build 800 apartments over a store](https://x.com/aakashgupta/status/2018188548147687631) in California than to build just the store, heralding a new form factor for big box retail. Food delivery has taken over dining. [Three out of four restaurant meals](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/30/dining/food-delivery-apps-doordash-uber.html) are now eaten outside restaurants.

The energy transition has won. The EIA projects [renewables and batteries will supply 99.2%](https://electrek.co/2026/01/28/eia-99-of-new-us-capacity-in-2026-will-be-solar-wind-storage/) of new US electric capacity in 2026. Tesla has achieved a major breakthrough with [dry electrode production at scale](https://x.com/elonmusk/status/2018064502487482661). Walmart is adding [EV charging to its parking lots in 19 states](https://www.mlive.com/news/2026/01/major-change-coming-to-walmart-parking-lots-across-the-us.html). Waymo is closing its latest round at a [$110 billion valuation](https://www.ft.com/content/94663caf-6c98-4883-b3f0-cc763a3b95ff). Meanwhile, transportation is leaving the ground. Pivotal is taking deposits for its [$190,000 flying car](https://accounts.pivotal.aero/order), expected to ship between April and May.

If your lobster sues you for emotional distress, just remember that at least the flying cars are finally shipping.
