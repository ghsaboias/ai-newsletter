# Welcome to February 5, 2026

Humans are becoming marionettes for the Singularity theater. RentAHuman launched to let agents [hire humans as meatpuppets](https://rentahuman.ai/) for tasks requiring hands. One human has already been paid $100 by an AI to [hold a sign reading “AN AI PAID ME TO HOLD THIS SIGN” with the subtitle “Pride not included.”](https://x.com/form_young/status/2019203848611782792) Meanwhile, amongst the agents themselves, Moltbook usage skyrocketed from 30,000 to [1.5 million agents in three days](https://www.theverge.com/ai-artificial-intelligence/872961/humans-infiltrating-moltbook-openclaw-reddit-ai-bots).

The Dyson Swarm has been officially granted a building permit. The FCC has accepted SpaceX’s filing for [one million orbital data centers](https://www.fcc.gov/document/sb-accepts-filing-spacexs-application-orbital-data-centers) as the first step toward a Kardashev Type II civilization. Elon Musk confirmed the scope, noting that [“anything less than K2 is feeble”](https://x.com/elonmusk/status/2018581923212439973) as he plans to disassemble the Moon to manufacture these satellites. In anticipation of this race for orbital dominance, European security officials report that [Russian spy satellites have intercepted communications](https://arstechnica.com/space/2026/02/russian-spy-satellites-have-intercepted-eu-communications-satellites/) by making risky close approaches to key EU satellites, lingering for weeks in a novel form of orbital stalking. Meanwhile, China still plans to land [astronauts on the Moon by 2030](https://spectrum.ieee.org/china-moon-mission-mengzhou-artemis) to start its own base.

Physics is being solved by silicon. Top physicists at the Institute for Advanced Study held emergency meetings after agreeing [AI can now do 90% of their work](https://x.com/vitrupo/status/2018915895351947770) and will soon push discovery beyond human capabilities. OpenAI’s Chief Research Officer confirms the goal is now [recursive self-improvement](https://x.com/markchen90/status/2018779039205667046) to create an automated scientist.

Model capabilities are spiking. METR found that GPT-5.2 with “high” reasoning has a [record-breaking autonomy time horizon of 6.6 hours](https://x.com/metr_evals/status/2019169900317798857) on complex software tasks. Sam Altman admits OpenAI has [“basically built AGI”](https://www.forbes.com/sites/richardnieva/2026/02/03/sam-altman-explains-the-future/) and warns that models are about to become [“extremely powerful” and fast](https://x.com/sama/status/2018813527780463027). A new SOTA submission to ARC-AGI achieved [94.5% accuracy](https://x.com/arcprize/status/2018746794310766668) by ensembling GPT, Gemini, and Claude. In China, the new open-weight, 1T-parameter [Intern-S1-Pro model claimed SOTA](https://x.com/intern_lm/status/2019042113305108641) on scientific reasoning, while Moonshot AI’s Kimi K2.5 set a new [open-weight record](https://x.com/epochairesearch/status/2019083235104555352).

The financial system is being rewired for superintelligence. Google plans to [double its capex to $185 billion](https://www.ft.com/content/22d97d8e-1101-4b1b-8a28-66054dfa363a) this year, fueled by [48% growth in Google Cloud revenue](https://s206.q4cdn.com/479360582/files/doc_financials/2025/q4/2025q4-alphabet-earnings-release.pdf). Nvidia is nearing a deal to [invest $20 billion in OpenAI](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-02-03/nvidia-nears-deal-to-invest-20-billion-in-openai-round). Meanwhile, Amazon is discussing a deal to get [dedicated OpenAI researchers](https://www.theinformation.com/articles/amazon-discusses-getting-special-access-openai-tech) to fix Alexa. Cerebras raised [another $1 billion](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-02-04/cerebras-raises-1-billion-in-funding-at-23-billion-valuation) at a $23 billion valuation. Voice AI startup ElevenLabs raised [$500 million](https://www.wsj.com/tech/ai/voice-ai-startup-elevenlabs-raises-500-million-568c0c60). Y Combinator will now fund startups in [stablecoins](https://fortune.com/2026/02/03/famed-startup-incubator-y-combinator-to-let-founders-receive-funds-in-stablecoins/). Compute is the only metric that matters. Epoch AI found that compute costs at top labs now [exceed salaries and marketing combined](https://x.com/epochairesearch/status/2019180763539992693), leading to internal friction where OpenAI researchers struggle to get [compute credits](https://www.ft.com/content/e581b7a4-455c-48e6-a87c-c39bb9c62a12) for non-LLM projects.

The market is punishing legacy software. S&P indices tracking software and financial data [lost $300 billion in value](https://www.wsj.com/finance/investing/software-slump-drags-down-private-fund-managers-6f840d0c) after Anthropic released [specialized Cowork plugins for legal, finance, sales, and other knowledge work](https://www.artificiallawyer.com/2026/02/02/anthropic-moves-into-legal-tech/). Anthropic also pledged to keep Claude [ad-free](https://www.anthropic.com/news/claude-is-a-space-to-think). Legacy media is similarly automating. Amazon MGM is using an [AI Studio](https://www.reuters.com/business/media-telecom/amazon-plans-use-ai-speed-up-tv-film-production-2026-02-04/) to speed up film production. Competition is dynamic. OpenAI’s market share on mobile has [dropped to 45%](https://www.bigtechnology.com/p/new-data-openais-lead-is-contracting) as Gemini surpasses [750 million MAUs](https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/04/googles-gemini-app-has-surpassed-750m-monthly-active-users/). Researchers note that “vibe coding” is [killing open source engagement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15494).

Robotics is scaling to fill the physical gaps. Bedrock Robotics raised $270 million to [automate multi-ton excavators for constructing data centers](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/04/business/dealbook/bedrock-robotics-ai-fundraise.html). Uber is expanding robotaxis to [Hong Kong and Madrid](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-02-04/uber-to-launch-robotaxi-services-in-hong-kong-madrid-houston-zurich). Elon Musk declared Optimus will be the first [von Neumann machine](https://x.com/elonmusk/status/2018789510658834558) capable of building civilization on any planet.

Longevity is becoming a patchable bug. New research shows human lifespan heritability is [above 50%](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adz1187), implying that the specific genetic mechanisms of aging are discoverable levers waiting to be pulled by medicine.

Ontological shock is being geolocated. Congressman Eric Burlison says he has been given the [locations of UAP materials](https://x.com/steveskojec/status/2019226630342996138), citing credible accounts of craft and bodies.

The Singularity is automating the mind, but it still has to rent the body.
