# Welcome to February 17, 2026

The Singularity just went airborne.

The U.S. military [flew a nuclear reactor on a C-17](https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/us-conducts-first-air-transport-nuclear-microreactor-bid-show-technologys-2026-02-16/) for the first time, in a mission dubbed [Operation Windlord](https://www.twz.com/uncategorized/this-is-a-nuclear-reactor-packed-into-a-c-17-globemaster-iii). Three Globemaster IIIs transported Valar Atomics' [Ward 250 microreactor](https://www.army-technology.com/news/c-17-transports-nuclear-reactor-for-us-military-energy-resilience-tests/) — a 5-megawatt unit that can power 5,000 homes — from March Air Reserve Base in California to Hill AFB in Utah, with Energy Secretary Chris Wright riding alongside the unfueled core. The airlift falls under [Project JANUS](https://www.nucnet.org/news/us-military-airlifts-next-generation-nuclear-microreactor-in-historic-first-operation-2-1-2026), which aims to build at least ten small reactors in under a year, with Trump pledging three critical by July 4. The urgency is not abstract: AI data centers, directed-energy weapons, and orbital infrastructure all demand watts that diesel can no longer deliver.

The intelligence explosion is cannibalizing the consumer economy. Bloomberg reports a [global DRAM crisis](https://www.insurancejournal.com/news/international/2026/02/17/858151.htm) as AI demand devours memory chips, with Elon Musk, Tim Cook, and a dozen other CEOs [warning of supply crunches](https://www.tomshardware.com/video-games/handheld-gaming/valve-confirms-steam-deck-is-out-of-stock-due-to-memory-and-storage-shortages-supply-of-popular-gaming-handheld-in-trouble-because-of-massive-ai-demand) since the start of 2026. Micron can meet only 50–66% of demand from key customers. Valve confirmed the [Steam Deck OLED is sold out](https://www.pcgamer.com/gaming-industry/valve-breaks-its-silence-on-steam-deck-oled-scarcity-and-yes-its-because-of-the-ram-and-storage-crisis/) in the US, joining the PS6 and Switch 2 on the [casualty list](https://www.eurogamer.net/valve-blames-dwindling-steam-deck-supplies-on-ram-and-storage-shortages-as-ai-driven-demand-further-threatens-games-industry). The machines that entertain are being starved to feed the machines that think.

Anthropic closed a [$30 billion Series G at a $380 billion valuation](https://www.anthropic.com/news/anthropic-raises-30-billion-series-g-funding-380-billion-post-money-valuation), more than doubling its worth since September, on a [$14 billion annualized revenue](https://x.com/AnthropicAI/status/2022023156513616220) run-rate that has grown 10x in each of the past three years. The velocity is partly explained by the wreckage: Anthropic's Cowork legal plugin [triggered a $285 billion rout](https://news.bloomberglaw.com/ip-law/anthropics-move-into-legal-is-sinking-data-services-stocks-3) across software and financial stocks earlier this month, with RELX and Wolters Kluwer [plunging over 10%](https://fintool.com/news/anthropic-ai-software-stock-selloff). Goldman Sachs is now [co-developing autonomous agents](https://fintool.com/news/goldman-sachs-anthropic-ai-agents-banking) with Anthropic for trade accounting and compliance, while [Infosys signed on](https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/17/as-ai-jitters-rattle-it-stocks-infosys-partners-with-anthropic-to-build-enterprise-grade-ai-agents/) to build enterprise agents on Claude. The *Washington Post* editorial board [called the jobs panic "misplaced"](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2026/02/17/anthropic-lawyers-technology/) — the lawyers reading it may disagree.

The safety researchers are voting with their feet. OpenAI's Zoë Hitzig [quit and wrote a NYT essay](https://www.scrippsnews.com/science-and-tech/artificial-intelligence/ai-safety-shake-up-top-researchers-quit-openai-and-anthropic-warning-of-risks) titled "OpenAI Is Making the Mistakes Facebook Made," warning that ChatGPT now holds an "archive of human candor" — medical fears, relationship struggles, career anxieties — about to be monetized by ads. Researchers [also departed Anthropic](https://www.aol.com/articles/ai-safety-shake-top-researchers-224433284.html). Stuart Russell told AFP at India's AI summit that the [arms race "risks human extinction"](https://www.france24.com/en/live-news/20260217-ai-arms-race-risks-human-extinction-warns-top-computing-expert), while Japan [issued rules](https://japannews.yomiuri.co.jp/politics/politics-government/20260217-311850/) requiring AI agents to consult humans before acting autonomously.

Musk's answer to the compute bottleneck is orbital. The [SpaceX-xAI merger](http://us.cnn.com/2026/02/04/business/elon-musk-orbiting-ai-data-center-plans) created a [$1.25 trillion entity](https://www.mindset.ai/blogs/in-the-loop-ep44-spacex-merged-with-xai) with plans for a million-satellite data center constellation in low Earth orbit. At the first post-merger all-hands, Musk unveiled [lunar AI satellite factories and a Moon base by 2035](https://x.com/thione/status/2023427090935324725) — mass drivers, self-growing cities, and compute that chases the cheapest energy source in the solar system: unfiltered sunlight.

China keeps closing the gap. MiniMax, fresh off its [Hong Kong IPO](https://venturebeat.com/technology/minimaxs-new-open-m2-5-and-m2-5-lightning-near-state-of-the-art-while), released [M2.5](https://felloai.com/minimax-m2-5-model/) — an open-source 230B Mixture-of-Experts model with only 10B active parameters that scores 80.2% on SWE-Bench Verified and 76.3% on BrowseComp, rivaling Opus 4.6 [at one-twentieth the cost](https://venturebeat.com/technology/minimaxs-new-open-m2-5-and-m2-5-lightning-near-state-of-the-art-while). It runs at 100 tokens per second for roughly $1 per hour. A new independent evaluation called [SWE-rebench](https://medium.com/coding-nexus/this-new-ai-benchmark-changes-everything-91b410266076) suggests some Chinese labs have been optimizing on popular evals — but M2.5 took first place on Multi-SWE-Bench at 51.3%, a benchmark that didn't exist when training began.

The infrastructure of intelligence is going global. Adani Group [committed $100 billion](https://www.cnbc.com/2026/02/17/india-adani-ai-data-centers-investment.html) to build renewable-powered AI data centers in India by 2035, projecting a [$250 billion ecosystem](https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/17/adani-pledges-100b-for-ai-data-centers-as-india-seeks-bigger-role-in-global-ai/) as the country hosts leaders from every major AI lab at this week's [AI Impact Summit](https://reuters.com/business/energy/indias-adani-invest-100-billion-ai-data-centres-by-2035-2026-02-17/). Anthropic [opened its Bengaluru office](https://x.com/AnthropicAI/status/2023322514206957688), its second in Asia-Pacific. At the Vatican, an AI called Lara will [translate Mass into 60 languages](https://www.euronews.com/next/2026/02/17/vatican-will-use-ai-to-translate-mass-in-60-languages-at-st-peters-basilica) at St. Peter's Basilica for its 400th anniversary, served via QR codes at the entrance — because even the Holy See has a product launch now.

On the darker side of generation, Ireland's Data Protection Commission opened a ["large-scale inquiry"](https://www.thejournal.ie/dpc-x-grok-inquiry-images-6959176-Feb2026/) into X after Grok generated an estimated [23,000 CSAM images in 11 days](https://9to5mac.com/2026/02/17/eu-also-investigating-as-grok-generated-23000-csam-images-in-11-days/) out of 4.6 million total. The [EU opened its own probe](https://www.euronews.com/next/2026/02/17/ireland-launches-large-scale-probe-into-elon-musks-grok-over-ai-generated-sexual-images). Apple and Google [have not removed](https://9to5mac.com/2026/02/17/eu-also-investigating-as-grok-generated-23000-csam-images-in-11-days/) X or Grok from their app stores.

The reactor is airborne, the Mass is in 60 languages, and the guardrails are still on the ground.
