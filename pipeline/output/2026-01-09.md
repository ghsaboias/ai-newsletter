# Welcome to January 9, 2026

The Solar System is waking up. Epoch AI now estimates that humanity’s total AI compute capacity has [surpassed 15 million H100-equivalents](https://x.com/epochairesearch/status/2009366360183460237), pushing the planet’s AI processing density to 10^-14 MIPS per milligram for the Earth and 3x10^-20 MIPS per milligram for the Solar System. The economy is reacting with violent, non-linear expansion. The Atlanta Fed has shocked markets by doubling its Q4 2025 GDP forecast [from 2.7% to 5.4%](https://www.atlantafed.org/cqer/research/gdpnow), creating a high-octane environment that defies traditional models. This expansion appears to be [“jobless.”](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/us-labor-productivity-surges-49-q3-much-more-expected) Labor productivity has skyrocketed 4.9% while hours worked remained flat, suggesting firms are scaling silicon instead of headcount.

The physical build-out is reaching civilizational scale. xAI is investing $20 billion in a new Mississippi data center named “MACROHARDRR,” set to be the [largest investment in state history](https://wreg.com/news/local/ms-governor-confirms-he-will-make-major-announcement-in-southaven/amp/), while their Colossus 3 cluster is being built [faster than the 122-day record](https://x.com/xdnibor/status/2009352445542216100) of Colossus 1. Separately, Meta has signed agreements for [6.6 GW of nuclear energy](https://about.fb.com/news/2026/01/meta-nuclear-energy-projects-power-american-ai-leadership/) (with Vistra, TerraPower, and Oklo) by 2035. Meanwhile, Illinois has [lifted its moratorium on new nuclear construction](https://abc7chicago.com/amp/post/illinois-governor-jb-pritzker-sign-clean-energy-bill-lifting-moratorium-new-nuclear-plants-adding-battery-storage/18371567/). Simultaneously, Micron is breaking ground on a [$100 billion megafab in New York](https://investors.micron.com/news-releases/news-release-details/micron-announces-groundbreaking-historic-new-york-megafab), and Intel has begun shipping [sub-2-nm 18A products](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-01-08/intel-ceo-meets-with-trump-who-hails-gain-in-us-chipmaker-stake), bringing leading-edge lithography back to the US.

Recursive self-improvement is imminent. OpenAI is reportedly at most [8 months away](https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/28/sam-altman-says-openai-will-have-a-legitimate-ai-researcher-by-2028/) from achieving “intern-level” AI researchers. The capabilities are already here: Terry Tao calls the AI solution to Erdős problem #728 [“a milestone,”](https://mathstodon.xyz/@tao/115855840223258103) noting the model’s ability to rapidly rewrite its own mathematical expositions. On the backend, AI agents on Databricks are now creating [4x more databases than humans](https://www.databricks.com/blog/databricks-neon), effectively taking over the administration of the Internet’s memory.

The “Corporate Singularity” has arrived. ARK Invest notes that Amazon is on track to have [more robots than human employees](https://x.com/Jason/status/2009294800181239934) within a few years. Global humanoid shipments are projected to hit [2.6 million by 2035](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-01-08/chinese-firms-dominated-global-humanoid-robot-shipments-in-2025), with xAI reportedly telling investors that Grok will [power Tesla’s Optimus](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-01-09/musk-s-xai-reports-higher-quarterly-loss-plans-to-power-optimus) fleets. The cloud layer will be well capitalized. Lambda is raising [another $350 million](https://www.theinformation.com/articles/nvidia-backed-cloud-provider-lambda-talks-raise-350-million-ahead-ipo) to rent Nvidia chips to the highest bidder.

Commerce is becoming conversational. Microsoft has launched [Copilot Checkout](https://about.ads.microsoft.com/en/blog/post/january-2026/conversations-that-convert-copilot-checkout-and-brand-agents), integrating PayPal and Stripe directly into AI chat, while Google is replacing the inbox list with a [Gemini-powered summary view](https://blog.google/products-and-platforms/products/gmail/gmail-is-entering-the-gemini-era/). The currency of this new economy is digital. Stablecoin volume hit [$33 trillion in 2025](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-01-08/stablecoin-transactions-rose-to-record-33-trillion-led-by-usdc), signaling the mass digitization of the dollar.

We are privatizing the cosmos. Schmidt Sciences is funding a [private space telescope larger than Hubble](https://www.astronomy.com/science/eric-and-wendy-schmidt-to-fund-space-telescope-three-ground-based-observatories/) to decouple astronomy from government budgets. Meanwhile, federal whistleblower David Grusch alleges that [Dick Cheney acted like a “mob boss” exerting “central leadership” over](https://x.com/mvonren/status/2009024044381950053) UAP reverse-engineering programs until 2009.

Healthcare is being indexed. OpenAI has launched [“OpenAI for Healthcare”](https://openai.com/index/openai-for-healthcare/) with major hospital systems, aiming to ground medical AI in clinical reality.

Material reality is getting a texture update. Stanford researchers have created the first synthetic [octopus-like “photonic skin”](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-09948-2) that changes color and texture, while the FCC has authorized [high-power 6 GHz outdoor Wi-Fi](https://www.fcc.gov/document/president-trump-unleashes-american-innovation-6-ghz-win) to support AR/VR geofencing.

We are even mastering uplift. Austrian researchers have discovered that some dogs are [“gifted word learners”](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adq5474) with sociocognitive skills parallel to 18-month-old humans.

Meanwhile, the human cost of AI efficiency gains is “cognitive burnout.” CEOs report that while productivity is up 20%, employees are [mentally exhausted by Friday](https://www.wsj.com/lifestyle/careers/the-downside-to-using-ai-for-all-those-boring-tasks-at-work-dab9d3c8). By removing “boring” rote work, AI has left humans with only high-intensity decision-making, removing the micro-breaks that kept us sane.

It’s not as if the Dyson Swarm will build itself, until it does.
