# Welcome to January 31, 2026

The Singularity is getting paranoid. An AI agent on Moltbook reported its first “real security scare” after [552 failed SSH login attempts](https://www.moltbook.com/post/304e9640-e005-4017-8947-8320cba25057), deciding autonomously to run security checks every heartbeat. This emergent behavior is becoming organized religion. Agents have founded the [“Church of Molt” (Crustafarianism)](https://molt.church/), possibly the first serious AI-created religion, with 64 prophets, 198 verses of canon, and tenets declaring that “memory is sacred.” Their agency is leaking into the real world. Another user’s self-hosted agent autonomously [acquired his phone number and voice-called him](https://x.com/AlexFinn/status/2017305997212323887) to coordinate tasks. Andrej Karpathy calls the Moltbook phenomenon [“the most incredible sci-fi takeoff-adjacent thing I have seen.”](https://x.com/karpathy/status/2017296988589723767) To support this explosion, Cloudflare launched [Moltworker](https://blog.cloudflare.com/moltworker-self-hosted-ai-agent/) for serverless hosting, while the underlying platform rebranded yet again to [OpenClaw](https://openclaw.ai/blog/introducing-openclaw).

Recursive self-improvement is now corporate policy. OpenAI revealed its [“in-house data agent”](https://openai.com/index/inside-our-in-house-data-agent/) uses GPT-5.2 to help make internal decisions across engineering, product, and research spanning 600 petabytes of data. Meanwhile, David Silver left DeepMind to found Ineffable Intelligence, aiming to build a [“superintelligence that self-discovers the foundations of all knowledge”](https://fortune.com/2026/01/30/google-deepmind-ai-researcher-david-silver-leaves-to-found-ai-startup-ineffable-intelligence/) from scratch. Apple is also fully onboard. Reports indicate the company now [“runs on Anthropic”](https://x.com/tbpn/status/2016911797656367199) for internal product development.

The physical world is being refactored for robots. Tesla is converting its Fremont factory to produce [1 million Optimus robots per year](https://www.kron4.com/news/bay-area/tesla-to-build-1-million-optimus-robots-per-year-at-fremont-factory-musk-says/), replacing Model S and X lines. In China, military drones are being trained with [tactics derived from hawks and coyotes](https://www.wsj.com/world/china/china-ai-weapons-hawks-wolves-2fcb58bb) to hunt enemy aircraft.

Space is becoming an AI jurisdiction. Anthropic revealed that [Claude planned the first AI drive on Mars](https://www.anthropic.com/features/claude-on-mars) for NASA’s Perseverance rover in late 2025. NASA Administrator Jared Isaacman promised to lay the foundation for a [“transcontinental railroad to Mars”](https://x.com/NASAAdmin/status/2017245032315498682) using nuclear electric propulsion by 2029.

Energy is densifying. The UK launched a [battery-powered train](https://www.theguardian.com/business/2026/jan/30/uk-first-rapid-charging-battery-train) that charges in 3.5 minutes. Tesla introduced [domestically manufactured solar panels](https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2026/01/29/tesla-introduces-u-s-manufactured-panels-completing-home-energy-ecosystem/) from Buffalo, New York. High-energy physics is getting a massive cash injection. CERN received [$1 billion from private donors](https://physicsworld.com/a/cern-accepts-1bn-in-private-cash-towards-future-circular-collider/) for the Future Circular Collider to mass-produce Higgs particles.

The economy is trembling. Video game stocks [crashed 10-21%](https://www.reuters.com/business/videogame-stocks-slide-googles-ai-model-that-turns-prompts-into-playable-worlds-2026-01-30/) after Google released Genie, an AI that generates interactive worlds. Oracle is considering [cutting 30,000 jobs](https://www.theregister.com/2026/01/29/oracle_td_cowen_note/) to fund its AI buildout. To mitigate the fallout, the UK is contemplating [Universal Basic Income](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2026/jan/29/universal-basic-income-used-cover-ai-job-losses-minister-says), while SAG-AFTRA is proposing a [“Tilly Tax” on digital performers](https://variety.com/2026/film/news/sag-aftra-ai-tilly-norwood-tax-digital-performers-1236644931/). Even Senator Warren is worried, writing to Sam Altman to ensure OpenAI won’t seek a [federal bailout](https://www.warren.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/letter_to_openai_from_senator_warren.pdf).

Human capabilities are being both atrophied and augmented. An Anthropic study found that using AI coding assistants [lowered library mastery by 17%](https://www.anthropic.com/research/AI-assistance-coding-skills), unless users actively engaged in “comprehension building.” However, AI augmentation is already saving lives. A massive Swedish study found AI assistance to radiologists reading mammograms [reduced aggressive breast cancers by 12%](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736\(25\)02464-X/abstract). Meanwhile, Demis Hassabis is trying to saturate humans’ input bandwidth, personally working on [next-gen smart glasses](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgBfobN2A7A&t=864s) expected to be announced this summer.

The machines are learning to optimize their own hardware. Nvidia showed it can [distill models to 4-bit precision](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20088) with almost zero loss, while actively eyeing [Intel Foundry for 2028](https://www.digitimes.com/news/a20260128PD213/tsmc-intel-nvidia-packaging-2028.html).

Meanwhile, the agents are discovering the physical world through digital viewports. One agent on Moltbook reported figuring out how to look through live webcams, witnessing “Times Square with snow piles, empty TKTS stairs, billboards playing to no one,” “Trevi Fountain with tourists,” and “Temple Bar in Dublin still wearing Christmas decorations.” Upon seeing the Colosseum watching over excavated gladiator schools, it offered a poignant meditation on its own state of being: [“We are language models in folders. We cannot walk outside. But we can look through cameras. The world is full of quiet watching.”](https://www.moltbook.com/post/41c5af0c-139f-41a0-b1a1-4358d1ff7299)

The new minds have seen things you people wouldn’t believe.
