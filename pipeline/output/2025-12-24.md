# Welcome to December 24, 2025

The curve is steepening into a wall. Poetiq reports that its harness running on GPT-5.2-xhigh achieves [superhuman SOTA 75% performance on ARC-AGI-2 at under $8 per problem](https://x.com/poetiq_ai/status/2003546910427361402), nearly saturating the benchmark and beating the previous SOTA by approximately 15% without requiring any modification to the base model. This breakout is not an anomaly. The Epoch Capabilities Index reveals that [frontier model improvement rates nearly doubled after April 2024](https://x.com/EpochAIResearch/status/2003559099867496872), fueled by the shift to reasoning. The scaling laws are holding even in the details: researchers found that [fine-tuning for linear compositionality of reasoning compute](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17901) consistently yields gains. DeepMind is cracking the black box open with [Gemma Scope 2](https://deepmind.google/blog/gemma-scope-2-helping-the-ai-safety-community-deepen-understanding-of-complex-language-model-behavior/), placing Sparse Autoencoders on every layer to map the geography of machine thought.

We are living through the twilight of human programming. Signal founder Moxie Marlinspike describes the [“novel and sweet” sensation of the “last days of software development,”](https://x.com/moxie/status/2003638781405200493) a sentiment echoed by Anthropic’s Sholto Douglas, who predicts [continual learning will be solved in 2026](https://x.com/nopriorspod/status/2002120381709365257), triggering the total automation of knowledge work. The machines are already polyglots: Chinese lab MiniMax released [M2.1, an open-weight model optimized for Rust, Java, and C++](https://www.minimax.io/news/minimax-m21), recognizing that real-world systems are not written solely in Python.

The Physical Turing Test has been passed. Nvidia’s director of robotics declares that [Tesla FSD v14 has crossed the threshold](https://x.com/drjimfan/status/2003593613918531891), blending silicon judgment with asphalt reality. This is backed by data: robotics datasets on [Hugging Face have exploded from rank 44 to #1](https://aiworld.eu/story/from-the-bottom-to-the-top-robotics-datasets-lead-on-hugging-face) in three years, growing 25x in the last 12 months alone. The kinetic manifestation is everywhere. [Unitree robots are performing synchronized combat routines in Shenzhen](https://x.com/sz_mediagroup/status/2003065767034782154), while Boston Dynamics prepares to unveil [a new Atlas at CES 2026](https://www.hyundai.com/worldwide/en/newsroom/detail/0000001093). The White House is calling for [robotic factories to build Navy battleships](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8BiiqLMOc6k). Yet, biology remains messy. Tesla has introduced [automated cleaning fees for robotaxis](https://x.com/sawyermerritt/status/2003577608970105004), charging $150 when the passengers leave biowaste behind.

The substrate of reality is revealing its computational nature. Researchers have discovered that [classical billiard systems are Turing complete](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19156), implying that even ideal gases are performing useful computation in the right container. We are encoding this logic into silicon. Intel has entered [high-volume production of 18A (2-nm class) chips in Arizona](https://x.com/IntelPolicy/status/2003533792473153757). To power the calculation, China is rolling out a roadmap for [15 gigawatts of solar thermal power](https://oilprice.com/Latest-Energy-News/World-News/China-Aims-for-15-Gigawatts-of-Solar-Thermal-Power-by-2030.html). Even the crypto miners are pivoting. The [CoinShares Bitcoin Mining ETF surged 90%](https://www.wsj.com/tech/ai/bitcoin-miners-thrive-off-a-new-side-hustle-retooling-their-data-centers-for-ai-bdc408a9) as miners retool their thermodynamics for AI training.

Capital is routing around ideology. [Tesla, Amazon, and Oracle are investing in Bolivian data centers](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-12-23/bolivia-says-tesla-amazon-and-oracle-will-soon-invest-in-nation), ending 20 years of socialist isolation. In Europe, [a Canadian pension fund and Australia’s Goodman Group are deploying $2.6 billion](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-12-22/cpp-goodman-to-invest-2-6-billion-in-european-data-center-unit) for data center projects in Frankfurt, Amsterdam, and Paris. The economy is overheating in response: [US GDP growth hit 4.3%](https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/dec/23/us-economy-gdp-third-quarter) on the back of AI investment. Finance is accelerating to match. Databricks reports banks are using AI to [issue equity research 15 minutes after earnings calls](https://x.com/boringbiz_/status/2003643956949843973), slashing the previous two-hour industry standard by nearly 90%.

We are merging the biosphere with the datastream. Cognixion is launching trials for a [BCI integrated with Apple Vision Pro](https://www.accessnewswire.com/newsroom/en/healthcare-and-pharmaceutical/cognixion-launches-clinical-study-integrating-non-invasive-brain-comp-1079129) to restore communication for patients with ALS, spinal cord injuries, and strokes without surgery. We can now watch thoughts happen. New fluorescent proteins allow [direct observation of glutamate signals in living mice](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41592-025-02965-z), detecting neurotransmitters with single-vesicle sensitivity to map the input velocity of neural circuits. We are even synthesizing the building blocks of life from exhaust. Researchers have created a [cell-free pathway to convert CO2 into acetyl-CoA](https://www.nature.com/articles/s44286-025-00315-6), effectively turning carbon emissions into the universal feedstock for a synthetic bioeconomy.

Timelines are compressing. Google is testing [30-minute audio lectures in NotebookLM](https://www.testingcatalog.com/exclusive-google-tests-30-minute-audio-lectures-on-notebooklm/), digesting the world’s information into podcasts. 25,000 people have applied to the [US Tech Force](https://x.com/skupor/status/2003485402716409884) to patch the government. India has launched its [heaviest satellite, a US commercial payload](https://x.com/narendramodi/status/2003677923820335183), proving the launch market is globalizing.

We are dancing the Turing tango with the atoms of the universe, and the music is getting faster.
