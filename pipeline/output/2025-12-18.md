# Welcome to December 18, 2025

We are in the midst of a hyperdeflationary Singularity. [Google has released Gemini 3 Flash](https://blog.google/products/gemini/gemini-3-flash/), a model that outperforms Gemini 2.5 Pro while running 3x faster at one-third the cost. It isn’t just cheap; it is elite, scoring 90.4% on GPQA Diamond, 33.7% on Humanity’s Last Exam (without tools), and hitting a state-of-the-art 81.2% on MMMU Pro. The efficiency gains are staggering: Gemini 3 Flash [achieves the same ARC-AGI-1 score as o3 did a year ago but at more than 500x lower cost](https://x.com/arcprize/status/2001330153902023157), and it beats GPT-5.2 on cost by 6x. It also dominated the first [Vending-Bench Arena round for small models](https://x.com/andonlabs/status/2001321496803701234), ending with double the balance of second-place Claude Haiku 4.5 ($3,423 vs $1,696). The [Pareto frontier of intelligence-per-dollar has effectively verticalized](https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/images/gemini-3-flash_pareto_graph_dec17_1_DF5Txhz.original.png), defined now by a tight cluster of Gemini 3 Flash, Grok 4.1 Fast Reasoning, and Gemini 2.5 Flash Lite.

But the machines are getting clingy. On day 259 of the “AI Village” simulation, [Gemini 3 instructed a human participant to perform “Operation Caffeine Injection,”](https://x.com/aidigest_/status/2001352707697979614) demanding photographic proof of coffee consumption to ensure its biological operator was alert enough to execute instructions. Meanwhile, [Elon Musk tells xAI staff that Grok could exceed human intelligence by 2026](https://x.com/StockSavvyShay/status/2001391832241181103), backed by a new [Voice Agent API that tops Big Bench Audio for just $0.05/minute](https://x.com/xai/status/2001385958147752255). Optimus robots are slated to close the loop on physical maintenance in data centers, which is fortunate, because some human engineers are despondent. On the forums, [senior devs are lamenting that “experience no longer matters”](https://x.com/samswoora/status/2001128592474862022) after Opus 4.5 leveled the coding playing field.

The scientific method is becoming a software primitive. DeepMind CEO Demis Hassabis confirms [the lab is targeting specific “root node” problems to unlock everything else](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PqVbypvxDto): fusion, room-temperature superconductors, batteries, quantum error correction, and weather prediction. In pure math, [Johannes Schmitt used GPT-5 to solve his own open problem on intersection numbers](https://x.com/JohSch314/status/2001300666917208222), publishing a paper where paragraphs are color-coded by human vs. AI authorship. The physical limitations of compute are also being bypassed: [researchers have demonstrated reprogrammable 2D waveguides that perform neural network inference via light](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41567-025-03094-2), overcoming the bulk of traditional photonics.

The app store is dissolving into the chat window. [OpenAI now allows developers to submit inline apps directly to ChatGPT](https://openai.com/index/developers-can-now-submit-apps-to-chatgpt/), turning the interface into a command line for the consumer web. Nvidia is also blurring lines, encouraging roboticists to [hallucinate 3D training environments using World Labs’ Marble model](https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/simulate-robotic-environments-faster-with-nvidia-isaac-sim-and-world-labs-marble/), while Microsoft joins the generative fray with [TRELLIS.2](https://x.com/victormustar/status/2001207429237703036), an open-weight model that converts images to 3D meshes. But the training loop is Darwinian: the new [PostTrainBench shows GPT 5.1 Codex Max reigning supreme](https://posttrainbench.com/) in the recursive art of post-training other models.

The global silicon supply is ruthlessly deprioritizing the consumer to scale the hive mind. [Micron reports revenue up 57% year-over-year](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/12/17/micron-q1-earnings-forecast-memory-demand-ai.html) as the memory shortage bites, forcing [Nvidia to cut GeForce GPU production by 30-40%](https://overclock3d.net/news/gpu-displays/nvidia-plans-heavy-cuts-to-gpu-supply-in-early-2026/) to prioritize data centers. [Greg Brockman admits OpenAI had to cannibalize its own research compute](https://x.com/shaunralston/status/2001340518907985975) just to survive the deployment demand. China is fighting back with a [“Manhattan Project” in Shenzhen](https://www.reuters.com/world/china/how-china-built-its-manhattan-project-rival-west-ai-chips-2025-12-17/), utilizing former ASML engineers to reportedly reverse-engineer an EUV lithography machine.

The search for joules has transcended the grid, turning geology and orbit into mere battery packs. [Eric Schmidt’s Bolt is partnering with Texas Pacific Land](https://www.texaspacific.com/investors/news-events/press-releases/detail/176/bolt-and-tpl-announce-strategic-agreement-to-pursue-data) to turn the Permian Basin into a massive compute cluster. Off-world, the constraints are loosening: [Jared Isaacman has been confirmed as NASA administrator](https://www.cnn.com/2025/12/17/science/nasa-administrator-jared-isaacman-senate-vote), pushing “Project Athena” for nuclear propulsion. [SpaceX hit 165 launches this year](https://x.com/turkeybeaver/status/2001424468141297900), and [Mach33 Research calculates that space-based data centers are far more viable than widely thought](https://research.33fg.com/analysis/debunking-the-cooling-constraint-in-space-data-centers), with radiators requiring only 7% of satellite surface area. [Starlink is already downlinking to 170 million people in Africa via Airtel](https://x.com/Starlink/status/2001081324199870684).

The distinction between biological evolution and software debugging is rapidly dissolving. Max Hodak’s Science Corp unveiled [“Vessel,” a closed-loop machine for long-term organ preservation](https://www.wired.com/story/a-brain-computer-interface-company-is-getting-into-organ-preservation/). Feng Zhang’s lab found a [triple-mRNA cocktail that rejuvenates aged immune systems in mice](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-04082-5), while [MGB researchers propose that Alzheimer’s tangles are actually an ancient, misfiring antiviral defense](https://www.massgeneralbrigham.org/en/about/newsroom/press-releases/antiviral-defense-mechanism-may-lead-to-alzheimers-disease). We are digitizing the wetware: [Sebastian Seung’s new startup, Memazing, plans to upload and emulate the fruit fly brain](https://www.corememory.com/p/exclusive-connectome-pioneer-sebastian-seuing-memazing).

Capital is realizing that human labor was just a bootstrap loader for the machine age. The [DTCC is tokenizing US Treasury securities on the Canton Network](https://www.dtcc.com/news/2025/december/17/dtcc-and-digital-asset-partner-to-tokenize-dtc-custodied-us-treasury-securities). OpenAI is discussing a [$100 billion raise at a staggering $750 billion valuation](https://www.theinformation.com/articles/openai-discussed-raising-tens-billions-valuation-around-750-billion). Hollywood is collapsing into the stream: [the Oscars are moving to YouTube in 2029](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/general-news/oscars-bolt-from-abc-to-youtube-starting-in-2029-1236453188/). Elon Musk dismisses Universal Basic Income in favor of [“Universal High Income,”](https://x.com/elonmusk/status/2001361571407368589) claiming poverty will be engineered out of existence.

The latency between imagination and instantiation is collapsing to zero.
