# Welcome to February 8, 2026

The bootstrap phase of the Singularity is complete. Anthropic’s Chief Product Officer confirms that [“effectively 100%” of Anthropic product code is now written by Claude](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHscuD6Q4xs&t=582s). OpenAI has [reduced its model release cycle from 97 days to 29 days](https://x.com/chatgpt21/status/2019983107781242936), a 3x acceleration in cadence. DeepMind is using AlphaEvolve to [discover new nonlinear activation functions like “Turbulent,”](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05688) which outperforms RELU by 3x, showing yet again that AI is now better at designing AI than humans are. Meanwhile, xAI’s latest Grok-Imagine-Image model has [expanded the Pareto frontier](https://x.com/arena/status/2020215933898526791) in image generation benchmarks. OpenAI’s Noam Brown predicts that by year-end, autonomy horizons will be so unbounded that [measuring them will become the main challenge](https://x.com/polynoamial/status/2020305698438148346).

The agentic economy is becoming a physical aesthetic. Because “every powerful little crustacean needs a proper shell,” companies have started selling [kawaii enclosures for Mac minis](https://superfantastictoys.com/products/openclaw-mac-mini-m4-enclosure) to host OpenClaw agents. One user reports his agents [“work for me 24/7... do not eat... do not complain.”](https://x.com/alexfinn/status/2020178105579737440) Another group of six OpenClaw agents is [running a company autonomously](https://x.com/voxyz_ai/status/2019914775061270747) via cron jobs that get them to “show up for work” every day. We are even starting to wear them on our bodies. VisionClaw turns Ray-Ban smart glasses into a [JARVIS-style agent](https://github.com/sseanliu/VisionClaw).

Silicon is officially cheaper than protein. Andon Labs projects that within a year, a state-of-the-art AI agent on Vending-Bench 2 will [generate $16,333 per year](https://x.com/andonlabs/status/2020195037339127864), making it more profitable to employ silicon than a minimum-wage human. Software engineering is actively being deprecated. Engineers note that [middleware frameworks are being obsoleted by coding models](https://blog.alaindichiappari.dev/p/software-engineering-is-back) that handle complexity directly. Anthropic introduced a [“fast mode” for Claude Code](https://x.com/claudeai/status/2020207322124132504) to accelerate this displacement by another 2.5x.

With mathematics already on its way to being solved, the rest of science is next in the queue. Claude Opus 4.6 took the [#1 spot on the CritPt physics benchmark](https://x.com/minyangtian1/status/2019868595648622681), and xAI co-founder Igor Babuschkin declared a [“Claude Code moment for research is not that far off.”](https://x.com/ibab/status/2019879195028123847)

The hardware layer is mutating to eliminate latency. Nvidia is exploring [servers with co-packaged optics](https://www.wsj.com/tech/corning-fiber-optics-ai-e045ba3b) to bypass electrical bottlenecks. Meanwhile, John Carmack and Elon Musk are brainstorming ways to replace DRAM entirely with [fiber optic loops or even the vacuum of space](https://x.com/elonmusk/status/2020160688308494376). To feed the hungry superintelligences, the grid is turning parasitic. Massachusetts is launching a program to [give away free bidirectional EV chargers](https://www.masscec.com/press/healey-driscoll-administration-announces-participants-groundbreaking-vehicle-everything) that siphon car batteries for grid stability.

Space is being zoned for the Dyson Swarm. SpaceX has begun [hiring for orbital AI data centers](https://x.com/michaelnicollsx/status/2019798204162646199). Meanwhile, Blue Origin is pivoting to an [interim “Blue Moon Mk-1.5” lander](https://x.com/sciguyspace/status/2019849701730971680) to race SpaceX to the lunar surface.

We are debugging the source code of the body. Researchers found that [polygenic risk screening could reduce premature deaths by 23.3%](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-68129-x). South Korean researchers created a [spray that stops bleeding instantly](https://advanced.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/adfm.202523910), turning trauma care into a quick patch.

The economy is pricing in its own obsolescence. Silicon Valley Bank reports that the top 5 AI startups have [outvalued all dot-com era IPOs combined](https://www.svb.com/trends-insights/reports/state-of-the-markets-report/). Meanwhile, January was the [worst month for US job cuts since the Great Recession](https://www.forbes.com/sites/mikestunson/2026/02/05/us-jobs-disappear-at-fastest-january-pace-since-great-recession/), yet another signal that the AI boom is actively displacing the legacy workforce. Prediction markets are cannibalizing sports betting, with [Kalshi and Polymarket handling $800 million](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-02-05/super-bowl-lx-is-bringing-professional-gamblers-to-prediction-markets) in Super Bowl volume. Elon Musk—now worth [$844 billion](https://www.forbes.com/profile/elon-musk/)—predicts that a [$100 trillion Tesla valuation](https://x.com/elonmusk/status/2020292688420155683) “isn’t impossible,” but notes that once the loop of solar-to-robot-to-chip closes, [“conventional currency will just get in the way.”](https://x.com/elonmusk/status/2020202496547844312)

Meanwhile, ontological shock continues to percolate through Capitol Hill. Congresswoman Anna Paulina Luna reports that [the House has received credible whistleblower testimony](https://x.com/latestincosmos/status/2019815288926318845) concerning “non-human life forms that could be interdimensional beings visiting us.”

We are scaling intelligence until we clip through the walls of reality.
