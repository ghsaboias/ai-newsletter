# Welcome to December 12, 2025

The cost of reasoning has officially decoupled from the cost of human labor. OpenAI has released [GPT-5.2 Thinking](https://openai.com/index/introducing-gpt-5-2/), the first model to beat human experts on GDPval, a rigorous benchmark testing well-specified knowledge work across 44 distinct occupations. By outperforming professionals on 70% of these tasks at less than 1% of the cost, the model signals the end of the premium on cognitive drudgery. It also cracks the 90% threshold on ARC-AGI-1 for just $11.64 per task, a [390x deflation in the price of reasoning since last year](https://x.com/arcprize/status/1999182732845547795). But the real signal is in the granularity: the model sets a new SOTA on SWE-Bench Pro (55.6%), achieves near-perfect recall on the 256k-token MRCRv2 document integration test, and hits 98.7% on Tau2-bench Telecom for multi-turn tool use. We aren’t just getting better answers; we are getting reliable, long-horizon agency.

But the frontier remains spiky. Benchmarks show [distinctive performance gaps](https://x.com/sam_paech/status/1999253145164386666) between models, with Claude still leading on creative writing while Gemini dominates judgment tasks. To manage this diversity, Artificial Analysis has released [“Stirrup,”](https://x.com/artificialanlys/status/1998841566627246173) a harness that boosts baseline model performance on economic tasks simply by framing the problem correctly. Google is tackling the usability gap with [GenTabs](https://blog.google/technology/google-labs/gentabs-gemini-3/), a tool that proactively builds bespoke web apps to solve your specific task, while simultaneously releasing the [Deep Research agent](https://blog.google/technology/developers/deep-research-agent-gemini-api/) via API to commoditize autonomous investigation. Google’s Logan Kilpatrick suggests this is the endgame: superintelligence will likely arrive not as a new model, but as [existing weights unlocked by better scaffolding](https://x.com/forwardfuture/status/1998845250316460453).

The gap between imagining a world and inhabiting it is vanishing. Runway has launched [GWM-1](https://runwayml.com/research/introducing-runway-gwm-1), a general world model that generates video frame-by-frame in real-time, controllable via camera pose and robot commands. To populate this new reality, the entertainment industry is capitulating: Disney has invested [$1 billion in OpenAI](https://openai.com/index/disney-sora-agreement/), opening its IP vault, including Mickey Mouse and Darth Vader, to Sora users.

The silicon monopoly is fracturing into vertical empires. Broadcom expects [AI chip sales to double](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/12/11/broadcom-avgo-q4-earnings-2025.html), driven in part by a massive $10 billion Anthropic order for Google TPUs, proving that the biggest players are bypassing the GPU shortage entirely. Simultaneously, Rivian is ditching Nvidia to build its own [Autonomy Processor 1](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-12-11/rivian-unveils-ai-chip-for-automated-driving-ditches-nvidia) at TSMC, moving the compute stack in-house.

We are securing the atomic inputs for the post-scarcity stack. Ionic Mineral Technologies has discovered a massive [critical mineral reserve in Utah](https://www.wsj.com/articles/trove-of-critical-minerals-uncovered-in-the-utah-desert-9bc509f9) containing 16 essential elements, potentially breaking China’s rare earth monopoly. Just as we secure the materials, the cost to store energy is collapsing: stationary storage battery prices have [dropped 45% this year](https://www.theinformation.com/articles/electric-batteries-ai-data-centers-dropped-45-year), radically altering the economics of grid backup for AI data centers.

Construction is becoming a product. Cuby has unveiled [mobile micro-factories](https://x.com/AGampel1/status/1999172630952214693) that industrialize home building, reducing skilled labor needs by 70% and costs by 30%.

Space is becoming a commodity jurisdiction. K2 Space has raised [$250 million to slash the manufacturing costs of medium and large satellites](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/k2-space-raises-250m-at-3b-valuation-to-roll-out-a-new-class-of-high-capability-satellites-302638936.html), targeting a $3 billion valuation to build the heavy-lift infrastructure of orbit.

We are mapping the architecture of sentience. The Astera Institute has launched a [10-year, $600 million project](https://astera.org/neuroscientist-doris-tsao-joins-astera-to-lead-its-new-neuroscience-program/) to decode the neural syntax of consciousness. Simultaneously, Palantir has launched a [“Neurodivergent Fellowship”](https://jobs.lever.co/palantir/fd952b52-7b9c-4056-a3dd-0bc41fcfe603) explicitly targeting “non-linear thinking,” betting that unique cognitive architectures are a competitive advantage in the AI era.

Society is attempting to legislate the phase shift. The White House has signed an order to [preempt state AI regulations](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/12/11/trump-signs-executive-order-for-single-national-ai-regulation-framework.html), flattening the legal landscape, while New York enacts laws [requiring consent for AI likenesses](https://deadline.com/2025/12/new-york-ai-law-consumers-film-industry-1236646078/) even after death. Time has named AI CEOs its [“Person of the Year.”](https://time.com/7339685/person-of-the-year-2025-ai-architects/) And OpenAI confirms that [“adult mode” is coming to ChatGPT](https://gizmodo.com/chatgpts-adult-mode-is-coming-in-2026-2000698677) in Q1 2026.

We have begun the final refactor of the physical world.
