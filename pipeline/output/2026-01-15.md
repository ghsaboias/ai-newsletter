# Welcome to January 15, 2026

“AI 2027” is starting to look conservative. Cursor has officially released support for GPT-5.2 Codex, calling it [“the frontier model for long-running tasks.”](https://x.com/cursor_ai/status/2011500027945033904) To prove it, the CEO of Cursor reports building a complete browser from scratch using the model, which ran [uninterrupted for one week](https://x.com/mntruell/status/2011562190286045552), generating 3 million lines of code to build a custom rendering engine in Rust. This shatters the previously official METR autonomy horizon of ~5 hours (Opus 4.5), effectively implying that software engineering is now a promptable commodity. The industry is already reeling. The founder of Browser Use asks, [“What is even the value of software at this point? You can literally 1 shot almost anything.”](https://x.com/gregpr07/status/2011582814484119835)

This acceleration is not limited to code. A UC Irvine math professor gave an internal beta of Grok 4.20 an open problem in harmonic analysis, and within 5 minutes it [discovered a novel Bellman function](https://x.com/PI010101/status/2011560477688463573) that humans had spent years seeking.

We are realizing the dream of factoring knowledge out of reasoning. DeepSeek researchers have uncovered a new [U-shaped scaling law](https://www.arxiv.org/abs/2601.07372) that optimizes the trade-off between neural computation and static memory, allowing them to scale “Engram” models to 27B parameters with superior performance over standard baselines.

The corporate stack is being rewritten by its own tools. Microsoft has quietly become one of [Anthropic’s top customers](https://www.theinformation.com/articles/microsofts-spending-anthropic-ai-pace-hit-500-million), spending nearly $500 million annually to power its products, and blurring the lines between competitor and client. McKinsey is now testing job candidates on their ability to [prompt its internal AI “Lilli,”](https://www.ft.com/content/de7855f0-f586-4708-a8ed-f0458eb25586) specifically evaluating whether they have the judgment to filter out synthetic slop the model produces rather than accepting it uncritically. Google has launched [“Personal Intelligence” for Gemini](https://blog.google/innovation-and-ai/products/gemini-app/personal-intelligence/) to connect user data from across its apps like Drive and Photos with a single tap. To feed these models, startup Kled has built what it claims is the largest [opt-in human data collection effort](https://x.com/avipat_/status/2011478875121889439), uploading 3 million files daily from 200k contributors to create bespoke datasets for evals.

The supply chain is choking on its own ambition. Apple and Qualcomm are scrambling against Nvidia and Amazon to secure [scarce glass cloth fiber](https://asia.nikkei.com/business/technology/tech-asia/apple-and-qualcomm-fret-over-strained-supplies-of-japan-s-glass-cloth), pitting smartphones against data centers for circuit board materials. Meanwhile, OpenAI is partnering with Cerebras to add [750 MW of ultra-low latency compute](https://www.wsj.com/tech/ai/openai-forges-multibillion-dollar-computing-partnership-with-cerebras-746a20e4) over three years, a deal worth over $10 billion. Radical architectures are also emerging from the labs. Chinese researchers developed a [memristor-based chip](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41928-025-01534-8) with throughput 97 times higher than existing hardware. The PC era may be ending. Jeff Bezos predicts local hardware will yield to cloud compute as [dramatically rising DRAM prices](https://www.windowscentral.com/artificial-intelligence/jeff-bezos-says-the-quiet-part-out-loud-bezos-envisions-that-youll-give-up-your-pc-for-an-ai-cloud-version) make personal rigs untenable.

Robotics is finding every last niche in the labor market. In Shanghai, Rushen Robot is rolling out humanoids for [elder care](https://x.com/xuejia24682/status/2010995194402127904) while, in London, Humanoid has robots working [uninterrupted 7-hour shifts](https://x.com/thehumanoidai/status/2011456483477561601) bin-picking bearing rings. Even leisure is being automated. In Japan, Kawasaki will offer rides on [robotic horses by 2030](https://www.advrider.com/apparently-the-kawasaki-horse-will-become-a-reality-you-can-buy/).

The energy transition continues to accelerate. Tesla has broken ground on a [$375M lithium refinery](https://www.teslarati.com/tesla-break-ground-texas-lithium-refinery-date/) in Texas. The macro shift is visible. Coal power generation in China and India [fell for the first time since 1973](https://www.theguardian.com/business/2026/jan/13/coal-power-generation-falls-china-india-since-1970s) due to the clean energy boom.

Genetic design is entering high-throughput mode. Rice University researchers have combined long- and short-read sequencing to characterize [100,000 gene circuits in a single experiment](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-09933-9), unlocking high-throughput genetic design.

Exotic technologies are entering the chat. GE Aerospace has demonstrated a [liquid-fueled rotating detonation ramjet](https://news.lockheedmartin.com/2026-01-14-GE-Aerospace-and-Lockheed-Martin-Demonstrate-Rotating-Detonation-Ramjet-for-Hypersonic-Missiles) for hypersonic missiles, validating a long-theoretical propulsion technology. Meanwhile, DHS reportedly purchased, and has been studying, an eight-figure device capable of producing pulsed radio waves that some investigators believe caused [Havana Syndrome in over 1,000 people](https://www.newsweek.com/havana-syndrome-device-finally-solved-mystery-report-11349658). In the civilian sector, Vermont has introduced a bill to [create its own state-level UAP task force](https://legislature.vermont.gov/Documents/2026/Docs/BILLS/H-0654/H-0654%20As%20Introduced.pdf), apparently following New Jersey’s example.

The structure of employment is undergoing a phase change. The CEO of Robinhood predicts a [“job singularity,”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJfKqKEyw1o) where AI creates a Cambrian explosion of single-person unicorns. Europe is hedging its bets. The EU has decided to [ban businesses from refusing cash](https://www.economist.com/europe/2026/01/08/why-europe-is-rediscovering-the-virtues-of-cash) to ensure financial inclusion for those left behind by digital systems. Meanwhile, to protect his likeness in this synthetic age, Matthew McConaughey has [trademarked himself](https://www.wsj.com/tech/ai/matthew-mcconaughey-trademarks-himself-to-fight-ai-misuse-8ffe76a9), specifically registering his staring, smiling, and talking, to legally block AI apps from simulating him without permission.

You’d better own yourself before they clone your self.
