# Welcome to December 17, 2025

The miracle of discovery is being deprecated by the Singularity. OpenAI and Red Queen Bio have [put GPT-5 in charge of a wet lab](https://x.com/mileskwang/status/2000977810123550778), where it directed humans and robots to invent a cloning protocol 79x more efficient than standard methods. It isn’t just optimizing biology; it’s accelerating hardware: Quilter’s AI designed a [two-board computer system in less than a week](https://www.quilter.ai/project-speedrun), compressing a quarterly engineering cycle into a few days. But the wonder is fading. Terry Tao compares the new era of AI-driven proofs to [a magic trick where “awe... can dissipate (or transform to technical respect) once one learns how the trick was performed,”](https://mathstodon.xyz/@tao/115722360006034040) signaling that the “magic” of mathematics is becoming a standard industrial process. To measure this new capability, OpenAI has launched the [FrontierScience benchmark](https://openai.com/index/frontierscience/) to test expert-level reasoning, while ChinaXiv is [automatically translating Chinese preprints](https://x.com/seconds_0/status/2000606845644505093) to finally unify the global scientific corpus.

The sensorium is fully synthesized. OpenAI has released its new [GPT Image 1.5 model](https://x.com/OpenAI/status/2000990989629161873), which instantly took the #1 spot on LMArena, while Meta unveiled the [SAM Audio model](https://ai.meta.com/samaudio/) to isolate any sound from any source. Resemble AI calls its new [Chatterbox Turbo](https://x.com/0xdevshah/status/2000631462786400718) a “DeepSeek moment” for voice; notably, it is MIT-licensed, giving developers a state-of-the-art audio engine without the restrictive commercial shackles of big tech. Google is organizing the output: [Gemini Deep Research](https://x.com/geminiapp/status/2000995663874814260) now generates inline charts and animations, while its new [“CC” agent](https://blog.google/technology/google-labs/cc-ai-agent/) digests your entire digital life into a daily briefing and drafts your emails.

The memory bottleneck is being bypassed. Nvidia and SK Hynix are developing [“Storage Next,”](https://wccftech.com/after-gobbling-up-dram-nvidia-sk-hynix-plan-to-introduce-an-ai-ssd/) an AI SSD capable of 100 million IOPS to feed massive model weights faster than HBM can handle. To pay for the compute, Amazon is reportedly discussing a [$10 billion investment in OpenAI](https://www.theinformation.com/articles/openai-talks-raise-least-10-billion-amazon-use-ai-chips) that would see the lab adopting Trainium chips. The physical footprint is expanding: Tesla has received a permit for [Cortex 2](https://x.com/joetegtmeyer/status/2001125412978495588), a 200-MW cluster for training Optimus. The next efficiency frontier is geographic: a new map reveals nearly [7,000 data centers are built in thermally suboptimal regions](https://restofworld.org/2025/data-center-heat-map/), identifying a potentially massive arbitrage opportunity for relocation to cooler latitudes.

Politics is becoming infrastructure. OpenAI has hired former UK Chancellor George Osborne to lead [“Stargate for Countries,”](https://www.ft.com/content/a6a8c7aa-9677-4208-a28e-a3ca51cb7aa3) aiming to export the American AI stack as a democratic bulwark. Simultaneously, tech giants are pushing the [“SPEED ACT”](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/12/16/ai-congres-permitting-speed-act.html) through Congress to radically reform federal permitting and fast-track the semiconductor buildout.

Robotics is learning from YouTube. Physical Intelligence has discovered that its VLA models can [align human video with robot data](https://www.pi.website/research/human_to_robot), allowing robots to learn directly from watching us. The business case is closing: Waymo has passed [$350 million ARR](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-12-16/waymo-seeks-to-raise-funds-at-valuation-near-100-billion) and is raising capital at a $100 billion valuation.

We are hacking the body without opening it. NeuroBionics is developing fiber-optic-thin interfaces that reach the brain [through the blood vessels](https://neurobionics.io/press/news/neurobionics-announces-oversubscribed-10m-seed-round-with-second-close-led-by-future-ventures/), avoiding craniotomies entirely. Doctors are ready: 84% say AI makes them [better at their jobs](https://2025-physicians-ai-report.offcall.com/). The timeframe of biology itself is expanding: Arb Research ranks the [birth of a healthy baby from an embryo frozen in 1994](https://www.renaissancephilanthropy.org/frontier2025) as one of the year’s top discoveries, proving we can now pause life and resume it decades later.

The market has developed insomnia. Nasdaq is filing to allow [round-the-clock stock trading](https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/nasdaq-seeks-extend-trading-hours-wall-street-gears-up-247-move-2025-12-15/), racing to capture the velocity of the new economy.

But the ultimate asset class is matter itself. Elon Musk, whose net worth now exceeds the combined fortunes of Bezos, Zuckerberg, and Buffett, predicts money will become irrelevant once we begin [disassembling the Moon via mass drivers](https://x.com/elonmusk/status/2001039650719256863) to build orbital data centers.

Enjoy the Solar System before we liquefy it for compute.
