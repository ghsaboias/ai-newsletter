# Welcome to January 12, 2026

The Singularity is forcing the creation of a transaction layer for the post-human economy. Google has launched the Universal Commerce Protocol (UCP), an open standard allowing AI agents to [interact, negotiate, and transact](https://ucp.dev/) across the entire shopping journey, effectively building TCP/IP for the agentic economy. This is accompanied by “Direct Offers” in AI Mode, allowing brands to [inject discounts directly into conversations](https://blog.google/products/ads-commerce/agentic-commerce-ai-tools-protocol-retailers-platforms/), and a Business Agent that lets brands [chat autonomously with shoppers](https://support.google.com/brandprofile/answer/16410382).

Meanwhile, the distinction between natural language and executable logic is evaporating. Linus Torvalds has begun [vibe-coding with Antigravity](https://github.com/torvalds/AudioNoise), effectively signaling that manual syntax is now optional even for the Linux kernel’s architect. This shift is systemic. The percentage of Linux kernel bugs found within a year of creation has spiked from 0% in 2010 to [69% more recently](https://pebblebed.com/blog/kernel-bugs) thanks to AI fuzzing. The democratization of high-level engineering is total. Shopify’s CEO ran Claude on a raw MRI USB stick to [build a web-based viewer on the fly](https://x.com/tobi/status/2010438500609663110), bypassing commercial medical software entirely. But while code is becoming free, compute is becoming destiny. Even Alibaba admits the American compute lead is looking insurmountable, giving Chinese AI labs [less than a 20% chance](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-01-10/china-ai-leaders-warn-of-widening-gap-with-us-after-1b-ipo-week) of leapfrogging US labs.

The physical world is becoming a “move fast and break things” meme. In China, driverless delivery vans are achieving cult status by [plowing through wet concrete and crumbling roads](https://x.com/klara_sjo/status/2010496361205059703), optimizing for delivery time over infrastructure preservation. In the US, Wing is scaling to [150 Walmart stores](https://wing.com/news/wing-walmart-expand-drone-delivery-coast-to-coast), bringing drone delivery to more than 40 million Americans, and building a coast-to-coast network. Europe is re-arming with Harmattan AI, a new unicorn producing [10,000 defense drones a month](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-01-12/dassault-invests-in-french-dronemaker-at-1-4-billion-valuation).

Orbit is splitting into light and dark. SpaceX launched the first “Twilight” mission to a [Dawn-Dusk Sun-Synchronous Orbit](https://spaceflightnow.com/2026/01/10/live-coverage-spacex-to-launch-1st-twilight-rideshare-mission/), securing perpetual sunlight for future orbital data centers. Conversely, Iran has activated a “kill switch,” reportedly using advanced jamming to [plunge 80 million people into digital darkness](https://www.indiatoday.in/amp/world/story/iran-protest-internet-blackout-kill-switch-jamming-kills-starlink-elon-musk-china-russia-technology-help-2850566-2026-01-12) by severing Starlink. Nonetheless, the race for the sky is crowded. China has filed plans for [200,000 satellites](https://interestingengineering.com/space/china-largest-satellite-constellations-approval), while NASA’s Jared Isaacman confirmed Artemis III astronauts will arrive at a Moon base that is [already “waiting for them.”](https://x.com/latestinspace/status/2010457826142138433)

Math, computer science, and even chemistry are yielding to brute force. GPT-5.2 Pro and Aristotle have solved [Erdős Problem #397](https://x.com/neelsomani/status/2010215162146607128), the third this week. NanoGPT Speedrun training times dropped, yet again, to [106.9 seconds](https://x.com/classiclarryd/status/2010545452832407943) via compiler kernel hacking. In the consumer realm, a YouTube hobbyist used mass spectrometry to [reverse-engineer Coca-Cola](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDkH3EbWTYc), casually resolving a formula that has been a mystery since the late 19th century. The energy substrate is finally densifying to match the compute. South Korean researchers built a magneto-conversion lithium battery with [4x energy density and 99% efficiency](https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlelanding/2025/ee/d5ee02644j), while the new Buick Electra E7 hybrid crossover hit [995 miles of range](https://electrek.co/2026/01/11/bladder-buster-buick-electra-e7-goes-nearly-1000-miles-between-stops/).

Biology is being upgraded alongside the code. Anthropic has launched dedicated [Claude products for Healthcare and Life Sciences](https://www.anthropic.com/news/healthcare-life-sciences), designed to handle HIPAA-ready medical analysis and automatically draft complex clinical trial protocols. Simultaneously, the FDA is relaxing [CMC requirements for gene therapies](https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/fda-increases-flexibility-requirements-cell-and-gene-therapies-advance-innovation) to speed up the post-human transition. Even vision is becoming adaptive. IXI is launching glasses that [autofocus using liquid crystals](https://www.cnn.com/science/autofocus-glasses-ixi-change-lenses-spc), eliminating the need for static prescriptions.

Governance is being refactored as an optimization problem. In an industry first, JPMorgan has cut ties with proxy-advisory firms to use an [in-house AI to cast shareholder votes](https://www.wsj.com/finance/banking/jpmorgan-cuts-all-ties-with-proxy-advisers-in-industry-first-78c43d5f), automating corporate democracy. The judiciary is next. A federal judge in Texas is using AI to [decipher facts and draft questions](https://www.wsj.com/tech/ai/how-ai-could-help-decide-your-next-legal-dispute-9cb12517) for hearings. Even truth is becoming self-healing: Grokipedia now conducts exhaustive research to [auto-approve corrections to itself](https://x.com/nasdaily/status/2010326795967684899) when challenged by users. Meanwhile, seeking total regulatory exit, Silicon Valley investors are proposing a Greenland “freedom city” for [unregulated AI and nuclear reactors](https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/greenland-freedom-city-rich-donors-push-trump-tech-hub-up-north-2025-04-10/).

We are installing Full Self-Driving on the invisible hand.
