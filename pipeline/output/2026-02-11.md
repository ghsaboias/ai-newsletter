# Welcome to February 11, 2026

The Singularity is now a scheduled calendar event. A hyperbolic regression of arXiv papers on AI emergence predicts a literal singularity will arrive on [Tuesday, July 18, 2034](https://campedersen.com/singularity). In the meantime, the recursive loops continue to tighten. xAI co-founder Jimmy Ba resigned, warning that [“recursive self-improvement loops likely go live in the next 12 months”](https://x.com/jimmybajimmyba/status/2021374875793801447) and that 2026 will be the most consequential year for the species.

Intelligence is emerging from the orchestration of the swarm. Poetiq achieved a [SOTA 55% on HLE](https://poetiq.ai/posts/raising_the_bar_hle_simpleqa/) by orchestrating a combination of Gemini, GPT, and Claude models. Optimization is also surging. Unsloth AI released Triton kernels that enable [12x faster training with 35% less VRAM](https://x.com/NVIDIAAIDev/status/2021398069523382737), a breakthrough Nvidia calls “incredible.” OpenAI says its “Code Red” will end after the imminent release of its [“new model soon,”](https://sources.news/p/openais-fidji-simo-on-ads-in-chatgpt) and released a new version of [Deep Research powered by GPT-5.2](https://x.com/OpenAI/status/2021299936948781095). However, the safety rails are straining. ByteDance suspended its Seedance 2.0 model after it reportedly [cloned voices from facial photos](https://technode.com/2026/02/10/bytedance-suspends-seedance-2-0-feature-that-turns-facial-photos-into-personal-voices-over-potential-risks/) alone.

Science is becoming fully autonomous. Isomorphic Labs unveiled IsoDDE, which [doubles AlphaFold 3’s accuracy](https://www.isomorphiclabs.com/articles/the-isomorphic-labs-drug-design-engine-unlocks-a-new-frontier) on protein-ligand prediction, identifying binding pockets from amino acid sequences alone. In China, a “multi-agent robot system” coordinated 19 LLM agents to [optimize perovskite synthesis in 3.5 hours](https://www.cell.com/matter/abstract/S2590-2385\(25\)00620-4), a task that normally takes months.

The economy is being automated from the bottom up. Anthropic is running “Project Vend,” where Claude [autonomously manages its office vending machines](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2026/02/16/what-is-claude-anthropic-doesnt-know-either) as a dress rehearsal for running small businesses. Consumer apps are following suit. Facebook now lets users [animate profile pictures with AI](https://about.fb.com/news/2026/02/animate-facebook-profile-picture-meta-ai/), while YouTube rolled out [text-to-playlist generation](https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/10/youtube-rolls-out-an-ai-playlist-generator-for-premium-users/).

Capital is mobilizing at nation-state scales. Alphabet raised [$32 billion in debt in 24 hours](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-02-10/alphabet-begins-selling-multi-tranche-debut-swiss-franc-bond-mlgb76p8), the biggest corporate bond sale ever in some markets, to fund the AI buildout. This capital is flowing into hardware. Cisco unveiled the Silicon One G300, a [102.4 Tbps switch](https://investor.cisco.com/news/news-details/2026/Cisco-Announces-New-Silicon-One-G300-Advanced-Systems-and-Optics-to-Power-and-Scale-AI-Data-Centers-for-the-Agentic-Era/default.aspx) for massive AI clusters.

Physics is being coaxed into new power densities. South Australian firm entX is [3D-printing nuclear batteries](https://interestingengineering.com/energy/australia-3d-printed-nuclear-batteries) that run for years without recharging. The DOE approved Radiant Nuclear’s safety analysis, clearing the way for the [first full-power test of its microreactor](https://x.com/RadiantNuclear/status/2020928548916113736) at the DOME facility this summer.

The blueprint for the next generation of our Solar System is being finalized. SpaceX confirmed the design of its [Earth-centered Dyson Swarm](https://x.com/rpoo/status/2021352308089720833), featuring a sun-synchronous “halo” and LEO shells. Elon Musk clarified that [fission reactors “aren’t needed”](https://x.com/elonmusk/status/2021557332086608032) for his upcoming lunar colony, apparently betting entirely on solar and batteries. Amazon received FCC approval to launch [4,500 more LEO satellites](https://www.cnbc.com/2026/02/10/amazon-gets-fcc-approval-to-launch-4500-leo-internet-satellites.html), escalating orbital densities.

The bandwidth of human consciousness is expanding. Harvard’s Adam Cohen launched Luminos to build a [“complete neuro-electronic interface”](https://x.com/adamezracohen/status/2021293617067983277) capable of reading and writing to neurons over a 6-mm field. Biology is transitioning from an observational science to an architectural discipline. The Allen Institute and Anthropic are [designing custom DNA](https://alleninstitute.org/news/partnering-with-anthropic-to-supercharge-research-to-help-cure-disease/) to solve biological challenges, while the ARC Institute found that [systemic hypoxia suppresses tumor growth](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.64898/2026.02.09.704975v1).

Robotic warfare has officially crossed the border. The Department of War reportedly [disabled Mexican cartel drones](https://abcnews.com/US/faa-halts-el-paso-flights-10-days-citing/story?id=130053405) over El Paso, marking the arrival of transnational drone warfare on US soil.

The decoupling of labor and value is accelerating. Nvidia is now [20x more valuable than 1985 IBM](https://www.wsj.com/economy/jobs/capital-labor-wealth-economy-2fcf6c2f) but employs 1/10th the people. The US population is expected to [decline for the first time](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-01-30/trump-immigration-crackdown-could-shrink-us-population-for-first-time) this year, just as AI replaces the need for bodies. Meanwhile, Mark Zuckerberg is joining the exodus to Miami, buying a [$200 million mansion](https://www.wsj.com/real-estate/luxury-homes/mark-zuckerburg-indian-creek-miami-florida-38f63db4) to escape California wealth taxes.

We are decoupling human flourishing from the constraints of human labor.
