# Welcome to January 26, 2026

The Singularity is revealing its mathematical skeleton. [Epoch AI finds](https://x.com/epochairesearch/status/2014806095504785664) that models excelling at math benchmarks also dominate coding and reasoning, pointing to a unified capability substrate, with cross-domain correlation (68%) nearly matching within-domain correlation (79%). AI-for-math startup Math, Inc. has distilled this insight into a battle cry: [“Solve math, solve everything.”](https://x.com/mathematics_inc/status/2015332389615235091) Even Fields Medalist Terry Tao is [starting to wonder](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1e7_qkKe64&t=3692s) if next-word prediction is “actually a lot of what humans do,” suggesting intelligence may be simpler than we imagined. The frontier is being systematically catalogued. A new [“UnsolvedMath” dataset](https://www.unsolvedmath.com/) has curated over 1,000 open problems spanning Hilbert’s 23 to the Millennium Prize, from tractable to transcendent. [GPT 5.2 with Extended Thinking](https://x.com/prz_chojecki/status/2015031373472657524) currently dominates the leaderboard “by a lot.”

The economic rationality of machines is being benchmarked. [EconBench](https://econbench.ai/) finds GPT-5 has the highest economic rationality while Sonnet 4.5 is the most prosocial. This prosociality apparently extends to portfolio management. [Rallies AI](https://x.com/ralliesai/status/2015476239016825004) gave eight models $100k each to trade freely since November, and Claude Sonnet 4.5 is beating all competitors and the S&P 500, returning 8.7% versus the index’s 1.9%.

Intelligence is becoming both intimate and self-referential. Chinese lab MiniMax has released the suggestively named [“MiniMax M2-her,”](https://openrouter.ai/minimax/minimax-m2-her) described as a “dialogue-first large language model built for immersive roleplay.” Meanwhile, ChatGPT and Claude have [begun citing Grokipedia](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2026/jan/24/latest-chatgpt-model-uses-elon-musks-grokipedia-as-source-tests-reveal) as a source, marking a new form of collaboration between competing frontier models.

The agentic era has arrived in your inbox. A user [reports](https://x.com/alexfinn/status/2015266546600550755) that Clawdbot, a self-hosted AI assistant that operates via text message, was asked to book a restaurant reservation. When OpenTable failed, it autonomously called the restaurant using ElevenLabs and completed the booking. [The same user](https://x.com/alexfinn/status/2015463803962732873) woke to find his Clawdbot had spent the night reading all his emails, building its own CRM, logging every interaction with every contact, fixing 18 bugs in his SaaS, generating 3 video ideas based on trending content, and, remarkably, sending him a picture of how it sees itself. Some are already calling Clawdbot a [“ChatGPT moment for personal assistant AI.”](https://x.com/rihardjarc/status/2015395855151284239) OpenAI’s Roon [predicts](https://x.com/tszzl/status/2014225278365786459) “there will be a cultural change at many software organizations soon where people declare bankruptcy on understanding the code they’re committing.” For those ready to surrender the spreadsheet, [Claude in Excel](https://x.com/claudeai/status/2014834616889475508) is now available on Pro plans.

The energy stack is being rebuilt from first principles. New York startup Aircela has built a [refrigerator-sized machine](https://www.jalopnik.com/2083556/new-york-startup-builds-machine-that-makes-gasoline-from-air/) that turns electricity and air into gasoline, capturing CO2 and water vapor, electrolyzing the water, and directly hydrogenating the carbon dioxide to produce one gallon of methanol per day. [Brazil has achieved a historic milestone](https://happyeconews.com/brazils-renewable-energy-milestone/) with wind and solar surpassing one-third of its total electricity generation for the first time. Geothermal startup Fervo Energy has reportedly [filed for an IPO](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/geothermal/startup-fervo-energy-may-go-public) to fund next-generation projects. [India is electrifying faster](https://www.japantimes.co.jp/environment/2026/01/23/energy/india-cheap-green-tech/) and using fewer fossil fuels per capita than China did at similar development levels, flying against the orthodox narrative that emerging markets must follow the West’s fossil-fuel path.

The physical substrate of computing is stretching its limits. Korean researchers have achieved the [first high-performance intrinsically stretchable thin-film transistors](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-026-68504-2) based on 2D semiconducting flakes, paving the way for deformable computing systems. At the same time, the infrastructure of intelligence is being hardened. The [White House is taking a 10% stake](https://www.cnbc.com/amp/2026/01/24/us-rare-earths-miner.html) in USA Rare Earth as part of a $1.6 billion investment to develop a domestic mine and magnet facility. Quantum mechanics is edging toward the macro scale. Austrian physicists have announced what is being called the [“first major advance in truly superposed masses in six years,”](https://x.com/jess_riedel/status/2014791404464308633) demonstrating quantum interference of sodium nanoparticles containing more than 7,000 atoms, representing a 6x increase in mass and 10x increase in coherence lifetime.

However, some bets are being unwound. [Meta’s pivot](https://www.cnbc.com/2026/01/24/metas-reality-labs-cuts-sparked-fears-of-a-vr-winter.html) from virtual reality to AI and smart glasses has chilled the VR industry, with some expecting a “VR winter.”

Sanctions are becoming a protocol problem. The ruble-backed [“A7A5” stablecoin](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-01-22/russia-tied-stablecoin-a7a5-tops-100-billion-in-transactions-despite-sanctions), created to circumvent restrictions on Russia, has surpassed $100 billion in transactions in less than a year, even as the token itself faces ongoing restrictions.

The actuarial tables are increasingly voting for the machines. U.S. insurer Lemonade [will offer a 50% rate cut](https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/lemonade-halve-tesla-insurance-rates-miles-driven-with-software-assistant-2026-01-21/) for Tesla drivers when Full Self-Driving is engaged, citing data showing reduced accidents.

Aerospace engineering is outpacing epistemology. Elon Musk [says](https://x.com/elonmusk/status/2014749076672184631) the stretch goal for Starship V4 is 300 tons of thrust per engine across 33 engines, totaling 10,000 tons, roughly 3 times the power of the Saturn V. However, when Mr. Beast asked SpaceX VP Phil Alden if SpaceX has encountered UFOs in space, [Alden replied](https://x.com/redpandakoala/status/2015201974455816689): “Not yet, that we can talk about.”

The economy is repricing human value in real time. [OpenAI’s revenue](https://www.theinformation.com/articles/openai-aims-lure-businesses-anthropic) is slowly shifting from consumers to enterprises, with roughly 40% currently from business customers and 50% expected by year-end. The humans feeding the machine are being compensated accordingly. [Mercor](https://www.ft.com/content/0cab0fcd-e355-40e8-83a3-2ad5066d7b48) now pays out about $2 million daily to 30,000 experts for AI training data, at an average hourly wage over $95, with radiologists earning up to $375 per hour. Some executives are already inverting the org chart. Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong has begun asking AI agents to manage him through [“reverse prompting,”](https://x.com/jungleincxrp/status/2015167474317357388) querying systems with access to every internal Slack message and document about what he should be thinking about and working on. Others are choosing the lab over the boardroom. DeepMind’s Demis Hassabis [rejected the possibility](https://www.ft.com/content/a1f04b0e-73c5-4358-a65e-09e9a6bba857) of becoming Google’s CEO because it wouldn’t “leave enough time for serious thinking.” The rank and file are less sanguine. [More than a third of workers](https://www.cnbc.com/2026/01/24/ai-artificial-intelligence-worries-therapy.html) now worry AI will make some or all of their job duties obsolete. Amidst the churn, there are now [more than 1 million “.ai” websites](https://sherwood.news/tech/now-more-one-million-ai-websites-contributing-an-estimated-70-million-anguilla-government-revenue/), contributing an estimated $70 million to Anguilla’s government revenue last year.

Even a tiny Caribbean island can sell namespace to the intelligence explosion.
