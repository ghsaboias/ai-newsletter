# Welcome to January 27, 2026

The Singularity has a new mascot, and it is a lobster. Due to trademark issues, the autonomous “Clawdbot” AI has [rebranded as a crustacean](https://x.com/moltbot), bringing reality into alignment with the first chapter of _[Accelerando](https://www.antipope.org/charlie/blog-static/fiction/accelerando/accelerando.html)_. Users are already treating it as a sovereign entity, setting up [dedicated Apple IDs, phone numbers, and Mac Minis](https://x.com/anitakirkovska/status/2015870473750642696) to give the bot digital personhood. Some commentators are calling it the [“first digital employee”](https://x.com/daveshapi/status/2015782428783050946) and the harbinger of post-labor economics. Elsewhere, the recursive self-improvement loop is closing. Anthropic introduced [MCP Apps](https://blog.modelcontextprotocol.io/posts/2026-01-26-mcp-apps/) to let tools render interactive UIs directly in the chat, while Factory AI released a coding agent that [analyzes its own interactions and updates its codebase daily](https://factory.ai/news/factory-signals). Even Andrej Karpathy notes that AI stamina is a [“feel the AGI” moment](https://x.com/karpathy/status/2015883857489522876), as agents grind through problems that would break human resolve.

The scaling laws are going vertical. Sam Altman is promising a model [100x more capable, faster, and cheaper](https://openai.com/live/) than current frontiers. This acceleration is contagious. OpenAI aims to [compress 25 years of science into the next 5](https://x.com/kevinweil/status/2015819361223639357), already processing [8.4 million weekly messages](https://cdn.openai.com/pdf/f4b4a5da-b2de-418d-9fcd-6b293e9dc157/oai_ai-as-a-scientific-collaborator_jan-2026.pdf) on advanced math and physics. The competition is fierce. Alibaba’s Qwen3-Max-Thinking now [rivals GPT-5.2 and Opus 4.5](https://qwen.ai/blog?id=qwen3-max-thinking) on 19 benchmarks, while Moonshot AI’s Kimi K2.5 has claimed the [global SOTA on agentic benchmarks](https://www.kimi.com/blog/kimi-k2-5.html). Meanwhile, Grok 4.20 Checkpoint is the [only profitable model on PredictionArena](https://www.predictionarena.ai/), actively generating alpha while others lose money.

Science is becoming a bulk processing task. Hobbyists are using GPT-5.2 to [attempt solving all 675 open Erdős problems](https://x.com/neelsomani/status/2015917995349115294), treating mathematical discovery like a GPU workload. NVIDIA has launched Earth-2, a fully open suite of [accelerated AI weather models](https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/nvidia-earth-2-open-models/) to simulate the planetary climate at unprecedented speed.

The planetary heat sink is being re-engineered. Karman Industries has adapted SpaceX rocket engine tech to [cool data centers with liquid CO2](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/l-startup-uses-spacex-tech-175628363.html), reducing space requirements by 80%. Saudi Arabia is reportedly pivoting its Neom megaproject to become a [“hub for data centers,”](https://www.ft.com/content/036b158f-ea34-46d1-ad0a-093eba031501) apparently viewing compute as the new oil. Microsoft is capitalizing, winning approval for [15 more data centers in Wisconsin](https://www.cnbc.com/2026/01/26/microsoft-wins-approval-for-15-data-centers-at-wisconsin-foxconn-site.html) and unveiling the Maia 200 inference accelerator, which boasts [3x the performance of Amazon Trainium](https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2026/01/26/maia-200-the-ai-accelerator-built-for-inference/). The broader ecosystem is scaling in parallel. NVIDIA and CoreWeave are investing another $2 billion to deploy [5 GW of AI factories by 2030](https://investors.coreweave.com/news/news-details/2026/NVIDIA-and-CoreWeave-Strengthen-Collaboration-to-Accelerate-Buildout-of-AI-Factories/default.aspx).

We are upgrading the optics of cognition. Bill Gates-backed Neurophos claims its optical processing unit can deliver [470 petaFLOPS](https://www.theregister.com/2026/01/24/neurophos_hopes_to_revive_moores_law/), or 10x Nvidia’s Rubin, using light instead of electrons.

The lag between cognition and actuation is vanishing. Demis Hassabis predicts DeepMind is only [18 months away from solving humanoid robotics](https://x.com/kimmonismus/status/2015445052214956204). The surveillance grid is also tightening. Apple introduced a new AirTag with [50% more range and volume](https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2026/01/apple-introduces-new-airtag-with-expanded-range-and-improved-findability/), while Washington State is moving to require [3D printers to detect and block gun manufacturing](https://blog.adafruit.com/2026/01/25/washingtons-3d-printing-bills-are-bad-for-stem-bad-for-business-and-bad-for-open-source-3d-printing/).

Longevity is becoming a circulation problem. British researchers found that immune T-cells release “telomere Rivers,” and transplanting them extended mouse lifespans by [17 months](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.11.14.688504v1).

The administrative state is being compressed into context windows. The U.S. Department of Transportation plans to use Google Gemini to [draft new regulations in just 30 days](https://www.propublica.org/article/trump-artificial-intelligence-google-gemini-transportation-regulations), collapsing the bureaucratic loop.

Meanwhile, Dario Amodei admits that [AI now writes “much of the code” at Anthropic](https://www.darioamodei.com/essay/the-adolescence-of-technology) and predicts his “country of geniuses” may materialize by 2027. He also admits, “I wish we had the aliens’ answer to guide us” regarding AI alignment, apparently hoping to skip the messy part of artificial superintelligence with help from non-human intelligence. Court records now reveal that the company also secretly spent millions to [destructively scan every book in the world](https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2026/01/27/anthropic-ai-scan-destroy-books/) for training data.

We are uploading the species to the cloud, one sliced book spine at a time.
