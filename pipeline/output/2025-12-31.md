# Welcome to New Year's Eve 2025

The timeline to Superintelligence has new dates. The updated “AI Futures Model” from the authors of “AI 2027” now forecasts a [2x gap between ASI and peak human capability by July 2034](https://www.aifuturesmodel.com/). At the same time, the training runs are decentralizing. Epoch AI extrapolates that decentralizing training compute is [growing 20x annually](https://epoch.ai/gradient-updates/how-far-can-decentralized-training-over-the-internet-scale), far outstripping the 5x annual growth of frontier training compute, and is on track to catch centralized labs by mid-2031. This convergence coincides with the moment orbital compute has been predicted to become cheaper than ground compute, pointing the vector of progress directly at a Dyson Swarm.

Mathematics is cooked. GPT-5.2 Pro has scored [29.2% on FrontierMath Tier 4](https://epoch.ai/frontiermath), a result that has forced professional mathematicians like Bartosz Naskrecki to admit that [“2026 will be a hell of a year.”](https://x.com/nasqret/status/2006147430589554771) The panic is productive. Naskrecki is now using AI to take [“intermediate steps” toward solving the Langlands Program](https://x.com/nasqret/status/2006209832865452308), while Terry Tao concedes that [“the definition of a mathematician will broaden”](https://x.com/mathematics_inc/status/2006117894305005762) as proofs become a collaborative synth-human output.

We are beginning to understand _how_ the machine thinks. Researchers have verified for the first time that [Transformers implement Bayesian inference geometrically](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22471), with residual streams acting as belief substrates, feed-forward networks performing the posterior updates, and attention providing content-addressable routing. Efficiency is also jumping. Berkeley’s new [ZIP-RC architecture reuses logits](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01457v4) to guide reasoning without any inference overhead.

The priesthood of code is being secularized. Stanford computer science graduates are finding their [degrees no longer guarantee employment](https://www.latimes.com/business/story/2025-12-19/they-graduated-from-stanford-due-to-ai-they-cant-find-job), as firms replace 10 juniors with 2 seniors and an AI. Meanwhile, Shaquille O’Neal has reportedly [completed seven “vibe coding” projects](https://x.com/amasad/status/2005821891181756796), and Claude Code autonomously built a [$30 bird feeder camera with custom firmware](https://x.com/clayhaight/status/2005399980022898939). The creative stack is merging. Adobe has partnered with Runway to [bring the Gen-4.5 video model directly into Firefly](https://news.adobe.com/news/2025/12/adobe-and-runway-partner). Knowledge is being re-indexed. xAI’s [Grokipedia now hosts 1.8 million articles](https://grokipedia.com/), roughly a quarter the size of the English Wikipedia.

The industrial base is pivoting to power the intelligence explosion. Elon Musk’s xAI has acquired a third site, [“MACROHARDRR,” in Tennessee](https://www.theinformation.com/articles/elon-musks-xai-buys-building-third-supersized-data-center) to reach its 1-million-chip goal. The energy sector, especially, is retooling. Caterpillar’s [power segment is now its fastest-growing business](https://www.wsj.com/business/caterpillar-generator-sales-ai-cat-stock-f5aa26a5), while jet engine shop FTAI Aviation has launched a division to [convert aircraft turbines into data center power sources](https://ir.ftaiaviation.com/news-releases/news-release-details/ftai-aviation-announces-launch-ftai-power-ftai-adapts-worlds). Capital is fully committed. SoftBank has [fully funded its $40 billion OpenAI investment](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/12/30/softbank-openai-investment.html), and Nvidia is in talks to [acquire Israeli LLM builder AI21 Labs for $3 billion](https://www.calcalistech.com/ctechnews/article/rkbh00xnzl).

Hardware is dissolving boundaries. Chinese memory maker YMTC is developing [“high-bandwidth flash”](https://x.com/jukan05/status/2006245974361137546) to fuse storage directly to GPUs in 3D. The air itself is becoming a sensor. The new [IEEE 802.11bf standard turns Wi-Fi into a native motion detector](https://medium.com/@francesco.pace/how-i-turned-my-wi-fi-into-a-motion-sensor-61a631a9b4ec). Meanwhile, supply chains are hardening. China now mandates [50% domestic equipment for chipmakers](https://www.reuters.com/world/china/china-mandates-50-domestic-equipment-rule-chipmakers-sources-say-2025-12-30/), while Intel confirms its [14A node will debut the world’s first High-NA EUV](https://www.intel.com/content/dam/www/central-libraries/us/en/documents/2025-05/intel-foundry-infographic.pdf).

Robots are taking over the physical service economy. Cava and Chipotle are deploying [Hyphen’s automated makelines](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/12/30/hyphen-automated-makelines-investments-cava-chipotle.html) that produce a bowl every 10 seconds. In China, [humanoid robots are directing traffic](https://x.com/commiepommie/status/2005871773208752480), and at least 36 humanoid vendors are preparing for [CES 2026](https://x.com/CyberRobooo/status/2005638902061637734). The tunnels are opening. The Boring Company has started [driverless airport loops in Las Vegas](https://www.reviewjournal.com/local/traffic/boring-co-vegas-loop-begins-reid-airport-rides-3601517/).

We are mining the latent space of physics. ML-guided simulations have identified [new 2D materials for proton-conducting membranes](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/acsnano.5c15161). Environmental remediation is advancing. ETH Zurich developed an [electrolysis process to neutralize DDT](https://ethz.ch/en/news-and-events/eth-news/news/2025/11/electrolysis-can-solve-one-of-our-biggest-contamination-problems.html). Biology is being debugged. Researchers linked [ADHD to circadian rhythm dysfunction](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/psychiatry/articles/10.3389/fpsyt.2025.1697900/full), suggesting scheduling as the latest therapeutic vector.

Societal violence is plummeting. Baltimore recorded its [lowest homicide rate in 48 years](https://www.thebanner.com/community/criminal-justice/baltimore-homicides-decline-48-year-low-U3UFWCQOUNHTHIUECCX3JK2KYY/).

On the eve of 2026, the Singularity is no longer a prediction, it’s a procurement order.
