# Welcome to December 22, 2025

The models are learning to learn in real-time. Swiss researchers have unveiled a [Meta-RL framework that allows agents to reflect on feedback without gradient updates](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16848), yielding double-digit performance gains in complex environments by turning test-time compute into active exploration. The metrics are confirming that general reasoning is the universal solvent for task complexity. Third-party analysis of METR data finds that [autonomy time horizons now correlate strongly with benchmarks like ARC-AGI and FrontierMath](https://x.com/emollick/status/2002861706658398211), suggesting that the era of jagged capabilities may be concluding and intelligence is becoming a smooth, predictable surface. Efficiency is the new frontier. A Google engineer confirmed [Gemini 3 Flash is a product of pretraining distillation](https://x.com/yifan_zhang_/status/2002745931649933724), while Harvard and Meta researchers proved that [updating query projection matrices is more efficient than simply generating thinking tokens](https://www.arxiv.org/abs/2512.13898) for long contexts. Even the visual cortex is scaling up. [AI image editor Reve forecasts 5-minute generative videos by 2026](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/disney-and-openai-signal-the-arrival-of-ai-video-streaming/), with hour-long coherent streams following shortly after.

The scientific method is being overclocked. Researchers using LLMs are [posting up to 50% more papers on preprint servers](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adw3000), effectively dilating the subjective time of discovery. The machines are increasingly handling the heavy lifting. Diffusion models have successfully [designed bimetallic alloy catalysts for low-carbon ammonia decomposition](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/jacs.5c14652), solving critical sustainability bottlenecks that stumped human chemists.

The landlords of the Singularity are changing. Financial giants like Blackstone and TPG are [planning 40 gigawatts of capacity](https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2025-ai-data-center-ownership/), signaling that by 2032, Big Tech’s share of global compute will shrink to 18% as Wall Street takes over the physical plant. The economics are finally working. OpenAI’s compute margins have [jumped from 35% to 70% in less than two years](https://www.theinformation.com/articles/openai-getting-efficient-running-ai-internal-financials-show), proving that intelligence can be a high-margin commodity. To feed the beast, China is building the [world’s largest solar park on the Tibetan Plateau](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/10/business/china-solar-tibetan-plateau.html), covering an area ten times the size of Manhattan to power its AI ambitions.

Algorithmic agency is rapidly acquiring mass and velocity. Google’s Logan Kilpatrick promises [2026 will be the year of embodied AI](https://x.com/officiallogank/status/2002831970586566824), but the deployment has already begun. China is deploying [Unitree humanoid robots in bulletproof vests](https://x.com/XueJia24682/status/1997849043926700438) for police patrols. TARS has unveiled the [world’s first autonomous embroidery robot](https://x.com/XRoboHub/status/2002618380319395926). Disneyland Paris is using [deep reinforcement learning to animate a robotic Olaf](https://disneyparksblog.com/disney-experiences/robotic-olaf-marks-new-era-of-disney-innovation/) that walks and talks with non-physical fluidity. The systems are becoming resilient. [Tesla FSD is now navigating San Francisco during power outages](https://x.com/edgecase411/status/2002630953844552094), driving through the dark without human intervention.

We are preparing to export this infrastructure to the stars. GITAI robots are [welding solar panels in the desert](https://x.com/GITAI_HQ/status/2002420011315384547) to practice for Mars. Rocket Lab closed the year with a [record 21 Electron launches](https://spacenews.com/rocket-lab-wraps-up-record-launch-year/). The Artemis II crew just [completed their launch day rehearsal](https://www.nasa.gov/image-article/artemis-ii-crew-rehearse-launch-day-demonstration/) for their mission to fly around the Moon in a few months, while Michaela Benthaus became the [first wheelchair user to cross the Kármán Line](https://www.cnn.com/2025/12/20/science/blue-origin-koenigsmann-benthaus-wheelchair) into space on a Blue Origin flight.

We are downgrading biology from a destiny to a technical debt. Bryan Johnson has updated his company’s mission to [helping humanity achieve immortality by 2039](https://x.com/bryan_johnson/status/2002873722726998284), while deep learning models are [identifying protective antigens for Mpox](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-67778-2), effectively reducing vaccine development to a compute problem.

The social OS is receiving a high-performance update. The valuation of individual agency is going asymptotic, with Elon Musk becoming the [first person worth over $700 billion](https://www.forbes.com/sites/mattdurot/2025/12/19/elon-musk-just-became-the-first-person-ever-worth-700-billion-after-delaware-supreme-court-restored-his-voided-tesla-stock-options/). We are debugging public safety, as schools like Beverly Hills High deploy [facial recognition and bathroom audio surveillance](https://www.forbes.com/sites/thomasbrewster/2025/12/16/ai-bathroom-monitors-welcome-to-americas-new-surveillance-high-schools/) to render violence obsolete through ubiquitous situational awareness. Even the drudgery of data entry is being transmuted into sport. The [Excel World Championships were won by folding origami](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Mx_xhiIRpw) inside a spreadsheet, proving that human virtuosity can bloom in any coordinate system.

The legal definition of personhood is being gerrymandered. While Ohio legislators introduced a bill to [bar AI tools from personhood and marriage](https://search-prod.lis.state.oh.us/api/v2/general_assembly_136/legislation/hb469/00_IN/pdf/), the Colorado River Indian Tribes have granted [personhood to the Colorado River](https://critmanatabamessenger.com/the-basin-brief/personhood-status-protects-the-life-of-the-colorado-river/), creating a legal landscape where a body of water has more rights than a body of code.

Some are drawing lines in the sand to define the soul just as the tide comes in to wash them away.
