# Welcome to February 24, 2026

The Singularity is being smuggled across borders.

Anthropic published evidence of [industrial-scale distillation attacks](https://www.wsj.com/tech/ai/anthropic-accuses-chinese-companies-of-siphoning-data-from-claude-63a13afc) by DeepSeek, Moonshot AI, and MiniMax, alleging the three Chinese labs created [24,000 fraudulent accounts](https://the-decoder.com/anthropic-accuses-deepseek-moonshot-and-minimax-of-stealing-claudes-ai-data-through-16-million-queries/) and generated over [16 million exchanges with Claude](https://www.businessinsider.com/anthropic-deepseek-distillation-minimax-moonshot-ai-2026-2) to extract its reasoning, coding, and tool-use capabilities. The attacks grew in [intensity and sophistication](https://x.com/AnthropicAI/status/2025997931589881921), with labs routing queries through proxies to evade detection. The timing is no coincidence: Reuters reports that DeepSeek's [upcoming model was trained on Nvidia Blackwell chips](https://www.reuters.com/world/china/chinas-deepseek-trained-ai-model-nvidias-best-chip-despite-us-ban-official-says-2026-02-24/) — the most advanced AI silicon on Earth — likely [clustered in an Inner Mongolia data center](https://en.sedaily.com/international/2026/02/24/deepseek-allegedly-trained-new-ai-model-on-nvidias) in violation of US export controls. A Trump administration official confirmed the chips are there but could not explain how they arrived. Export controls are a policy memo; smuggling is a logistics problem.

**The Pentagon is testing a different kind of extraction.** Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth [summoned Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei](https://www.axios.com/2026/02/23/hegseth-dario-pentagon-meeting-antrhopic-claude) to the Pentagon today in what officials describe as a [high-stakes ultimatum](https://apnews.com/article/anthropic-hegseth-ai-pentagon-military-3d86c9296fe953ec0591fcde6a613aba) over Claude's military restrictions. Anthropic is the [only major AI lab](https://www.cnbc.com/2026/02/23/anthropic-ai-dario-defense-secretary-pete-hegseth.html) that refuses to allow mass domestic surveillance or fully autonomous weapons — OpenAI, Google, and xAI have all agreed to unrestricted terms. The Pentagon has threatened to designate Anthropic a ["supply chain risk"](https://wtop.com/business-finance/2026/02/hegseth-and-anthropic-ceo-set-to-meet-as-debate-intensifies-over-the-militarys-use-of-ai/), the Huawei treatment, if it won't comply. Meanwhile, the Air Force's [drone wingmen have started flying armed](https://www.defenseone.com/business/2026/02/air-forces-drone-wingmen-have-started-flying-weapons/411625/), with AI-piloted MQ-20s teaming with F-22s for mock combat missions, and the Army awarded [$5.2 million for the Bumblebee V2](https://www.defensenews.com/news/your-military/2026/02/13/us-army-to-debut-fpv-bumblebee-v2-drone-interceptor-next-month/), an AI drone that hunts other drones by ramming them out of the sky. The autonomous kill chain is being assembled one meeting at a time.

**Wall Street is pricing in the disruption.** A [bearish report from Citrini Research](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsdpKcFwpt4) outlining a hypothetical 2028 scenario of AI-driven mass unemployment sent [IBM to its worst single-day plunge in 25 years](http://globeandmail.com/investing/markets/inside-the-market/article-tech-stocks-ai-investing/) and dragged down software, payment, and delivery stocks Monday. The enterprise SaaS sector's forward P/E has [collapsed from 39x to 21x](https://markets.financialcontent.com/wedbush/article/marketminute-2026-2-6-the-great-software-de-rating-ai-fears-trigger-sharpest-valuation-collapse-since-2002) — the sharpest four-month compression since 2002. AI is no longer lifting all boats; it's [sinking ships](http://polling.reuters.com/business/stock-market-ai-turns-lifting-all-boats-sinking-ships-2026-02-12/). Nvidia reports Wednesday with consensus at [$65.7 billion in Q4 revenue](https://www.kiplinger.com/investing/live/nvidia-earnings-live-updates-and-commentary-february-2026) (+67% YoY), Blackwell sold out through mid-2026. Someone still has to build the machines that eat the white-collar economy.

**The capabilities keep compounding regardless.** OpenAI launched [GPT-5.3-Codex-Spark](https://openai.com/index/introducing-gpt-5-3-codex-spark/), its first real-time coding model, pushing over [1,000 tokens per second](https://openai.com/index/introducing-gpt-5-3-codex-spark/) on Cerebras hardware — Altman says [Codex users have tripled](https://x.com/sama/status/2023233085509410833) since January, with India its [fastest-growing market](https://x.com/sama/status/2024826822060290508). Claude Opus 4.6 leads the [Jenova long-context agentic benchmark at 76%](https://www.jenova.ai/en/resources/jenova-ai-long-context-agentic-orchestration-benchmark-february-2026), GPT-5.2 Pro tops the [overall LLM rankings](https://awesomeagents.ai/leaderboards/overall-llm-rankings-feb-2026/) by a hair, and Anthropic published a [theory of why AI acts human](https://x.com/AnthropicAI/status/2026062454405415369) — the "persona selection model" — arguing that Claude inherits character traits from fictional role models in its training data. The machine is becoming a character in its own story.

**India is becoming the next compute frontier.** Tata Group and OpenAI [formalized a sweeping partnership](https://openai.com/index/openai-for-india/) spanning Enterprise ChatGPT for thousands of Tata employees, TCS HyperVault [data centers starting at 100 megawatts](http://www.gulfnews.com/business/tata-group-openai-to-build-big-ai-hub-in-india-give-chatgpt-to-staff-1.500453478) scaling to a gigawatt, and [joint agentic AI solutions](https://www.tradingview.com/news/reuters.com,2026-02-24:newsml_ZawbtlWQ6:0-zawya-pressr-tata-group-and-openai-forge-foundational-partnership/) for global industries. India now hosts [over 100 million weekly ChatGPT users](https://openai.com/index/openai-for-india/). The capital pipeline elsewhere is just as aggressive: Fei-Fei Li's World Labs [raised $1 billion](https://www.reuters.com/business/ai-pioneer-fei-fei-lis-world-labs-raises-1-billion-funding-2026-02-18/) for spatial intelligence, David Silver's Ineffable Intelligence is [raising $1 billion with no product](https://siliconangle.com/2026/02/18/new-ai-startup-ineffable-intelligence-reportedly-raising-1b-funding-round/), and Ricursive Intelligence — founded by Anthropic alumni behind Google's Alpha Chip — [closed $335 million at a $4 billion valuation](https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/16/how-ricursive-intelligence-raised-335m-at-a-4b-valuation-in-4-months) in four months.

**The reactor is getting an AI copilot.** Idaho National Laboratory and NVIDIA [launched "Prometheus"](https://www.ans.org/news/2026-02-23/article-7774/inl-teams-with-nvidia-in-prometheus-project-to-accelerate-nuclear-deployment/), a grand challenge to [halve nuclear deployment timelines](https://www.powermag.com/inl-enlists-nvidia-on-prometheus-ai-effort-to-halve-nuclear-deployment-timelines-under-doe-genesis-mission/) and cut costs 50% through AI-driven design, licensing, and operations under the DOE's [Genesis Mission](https://www.powermag.com/doe-details-26-genesis-mission-ai-challenges-targeting-nuclear-timelines-grid-planning-and-energy-systems/). Waymo began [fully autonomous operations with its 6th-generation Driver](https://waymo.com/blog/2026/02/ro-on-6th-gen-waymo-driver), cutting sensors [42%](https://electrek.co/2026/02/12/waymo-begins-fully-autonomous-ops-with-6th-gen-driver-targets-1m-weekly-rides/) and targeting [1 million weekly rides](https://electrek.co/2026/02/12/waymo-begins-fully-autonomous-ops-with-6th-gen-driver-targets-1m-weekly-rides/) — a hardware simplification that signals mass production. Tesla [sued the California DMV](https://www.teslarati.com/tesla-sues-california-dmv-over-autopilot-and-fsd-advertising-ruling/) to reverse a ruling that labeled "Autopilot" and "Full Self-Driving" as false advertising, calling the order ["factually wrong" and "unconstitutional"](https://www.engadget.com/transportation/evs/tesla-sues-california-dmv-after-it-banned-the-term-autopilot-090845766.html).

The intelligence was distilled, the chips were smuggled, and the one company that drew a red line got summoned to the Pentagon — but at least the guardrails have a meeting scheduled.
